The bald eagle is indigenous to the area and played a major role in the naming of the course. During its construction, bald eagle sightings were plentiful. Since the river bends around the course, the name Eagle Bend was a natural. No signature hole is designated, but a consensus favors #16, a 560-yard, par 5 with a split fairway, and #17, an elevated 165-yard, par 3.

By no means is this a flat Kansas course. A new irrigation system has also been implemented. This course is both enjoyable and challenging, and meets the competitive needs of both novice and advanced golfers.

The fairways are tree lined and the rolling terrain provides challenging elevation changes, and beautiful views of the falcons circling overhead. The greens are large (averaging 8,000 square feet), undulating and fast, registering between 10 and 12on the stimp meter. Water comes into play on three holes.

The facility has three nine-hole courses that are traditionally played in combinations -- The Front and West nines and the Front and Back nines -- to create an 18-hole round.\r\n\r\nThe terrain features rolling fairways and scores of mature, lofty trees. Those, combined with elevation changes between the tees and the fairways, and the fairways and the greens, place a premium on distance control and shot selection.\r\n\r\nSouthern Hills has a great blend of long par 3s, short par 4s and challenging par 5s. Water comes into play on several holes, and many of the longer holes have doglegs, so players must shape tee shots around corners and into specific areas if they want to attack the fast, undulating greens.\r\n\r\nSouthern Hills hosted 1958, 1977 and 2001 U.S. Opens, as well as the 1994 and 2007 PGA Championships.\r\n\r\nFor a complete, hole-by-hole look at how Southern Hills was set up for the 2007 PGA Championship, click here.\r\n\r\nThis Club has multiple courses:\r\n\r\n    Front & West\r\n    Front Nine/Back Nine','918-494-0001','','','','','','','','2636 E 61St St\r\nTulsa, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed4ca61c-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 74136-1207 ','Private','Bill Coore & Ben Crenshaw','1992','Bent Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','71-80','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$100.00 - $100.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Dave Bryan',0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('30535075-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','PAGE BELCHER GOLF COURSE','This facility offers two eighteen hole courses.

The courses are built on hilly terrain, so expect some uneven lies. The tree-lined fairways are narrow and typically fast, while the greens are slightly undulating, providing just enough break to make them difficult to read. The course has many large trees that can affect your shots as well as Frederick Creek, which runs throughout the design, providing an additional hazard. Locals say that there are several outstanding holes on the course. Two of these are holes #5 and #6 on the Lakes Course. Hole #5, a 371-yard, par 4, requires a tee shot through a chute of trees to a fairway forty feet below the tee box, lined on the left by Frederick Creek. Hole #6, a 396-yard, par 4, requires a downhill tee shot that needs to be long, then an intimidating, uphill approach shot over trees and a creek to the green.

Voted the best new course of 2007 by GOLF Magazine, at Chambers Bay the visuals scream Ireland: giant sand dunes, rumpled fairways, stunning sea views, and unpredictable weather (photo gallery). But this superb new course is almost 5,000 miles west of Ballybunion, atop an old gravel mine about an hour south of Seattle, Washington. This Robert Trent Jones II municipal design is a walkers-only feast for the eyes, a relentless test of both swing and stamina. Call it Bethpage Black-by-the-Sea.    The eye candy commences right at the 1st hole, with a 50-foot-high dune to the right and the backdrop of Puget Sound. It gets better from there. Highlights include the par-4 5th, called \'Free Fall,\' which plummets 80 feet from tee to landing area and which culminates in two separate greens-150 yards apart. The farther green is receptive to a low-running approach, the closer one fiercely guarded by sand. The dearth of forced carries means Chambers Bay is playable for all, though a memorable exception to that is the jaw-dropping par-3 9th, its wavy potato chip-contoured green perched on the far side of a ravine.     Chambers Bay earns the greatest compliment its possible to bestow on a new course: By the time your caddie replaces the flag at 18, all you can think about is repeating the journey.\r\n','253-460-4653','','','','','','','','6320 Grandview Drive West University Place, WA 98467','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','edad8259-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 98467','public','Robert Trent Jones II, LLC','0','Fescue','Fescue','no','31-40','Sprinkler Heads Marked','$89 - $175','Yes','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Brent Zepp, Nicholas Pike',1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('3c279b39-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','SINGING WINDS GOLF COURSE','This course is enjoyable to play.

This more than likely was a result of its well-designed course features, like the tree-lined fairways which afford generous landing areas, or the medium speed, slightly undulating, greens. A water hazard comes into play on hole #7. The signature hole is #9, a 540-yard, par 5, requiring a tee shot up a dogleg fairway, then an approach to a slightly elevated green that will hold any high shot.

But this superb new course is almost 5,000 miles west of Ballybunion, atop an old gravel mine about an hour south of Seattle, Washington. This Robert Trent Jones II municipal design is a walkers-only feast for the eyes, a relentless test of both swing and stamina. Call it Bethpage Black-by-the-Sea.\r\nThe eye candy commences right at the 1st hole, with a 50-foot-high dune to the right and the backdrop of Puget Sound. It gets better from there. Highlights include the par-4 5th, called \'Free Fall,\' which plummets 80 feet from tee to landing area and which culminates in two separate greens-150 yards apart. The farther green is receptive to a low-running approach, the closer one fiercely guarded by sand. The dearth of forced carries means Chambers Bay is playable for all, though a memorable exception to that is the jaw-dropping par-3 9th, its wavy potato chip-contoured green perched on the far side of a ravine.\r\nChambers Bay earns the greatest compliment its possible to bestow on a new course: By the time your caddie replaces the flag at 18, all you can think about is repeating the journey.\r\nFor more information, go to chambersbaygolf.com.','253-460-4653','','','','','','','','6320 Grandview Drive West University Place, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','edad8259-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 98467 ','Public','Robert Trent Jones II, LLC','0','Fescue','Fescue','No','31-40','Sprinkler Heads Marked','$89 - $175','Yes','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Brent Zepp, Nicholas Pike',1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('47d4e1f8-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','LAKEVIEW PAR 3 GOLF CHALLENGE','The PGA rated this as the hardest par 3 course in the nation back in 1990.

The head professional states that one of the finest features regarding this facility is that they never have temporary greens.','509-349-2603','','','','','','','','10400 Sagehill Rd SE Warden, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','edad8259-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 98857-9584','Public','','1965','Bent Grass','Fescue','Yes','21-30','150 Yard Markers Only','$17.00 - $22.00','No','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Chad Disney',1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('4839e145-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','LOS LAGOS GOLF CLUB','Open January 2001, Los Lagos Golf Club is an 18-hole championship track designed by the team of Von Hagge, Smelek and Baril.

The designers, however, have moved a lot of dirt, providing mounds on the sides of each fairway, which not only throw all stray balls towards the center but also hide the adjoining fairways from each other.\r\nMost of the greens are elevated on at least one or two sides, resulting in large collection areas at the base of the greens. These areas provide for a substantial challenge in chipping the ball up to the green and stopping it near the pin.\r\nAnother unique feature of the course, adding to the difficulty around the greens, is an apron in front of the greens. This is an area similar to the collection areas, except they are level with the fairway, with the grass, again, cut very short. When you see these areas from back in the fairway, it appears that they are part of the green, giving you the impression that the green is much larger than it really is. The greens are undulating, mostly large and tough to read. Several greens are tiered and some have a ridge in the center, with the back of the green sloping downhill away from you. A good example of this is hole #4. The scorecard has a diagram of each hole plus a detailed description of the hole and how to play it.\r\nSand bunkers make up a very important part of the design and they come in multiple shapes and depths. There are bunkers with multiple fingers, like on hole #11, some that are built into the mounds on the fairways, like on hole #16, and other deep, grave-like bunkers, such as hole #14.\r\nThe signature hole is hole #8, a 464-yard, par 4, which is also the number one handicap hole. The charm of this hole is the original barn of the Langdon Farms, circa 1918. The barn is considered part of the hole design so you need to stay to the right side of the fairway in order to avoid it.\r\nWater hazards (two ponds and a creek) come into play on four holes.

Designed by Tom Doak/Jim Urbina and a cast of consultants - with inspiration from America\'s pioneering golf course architect, Charles Blair Macdonald, Old Macdonald attempts to answer the question, \'What would C.B. Macdonald have done today if he were given this piece of land?\'\r\nAs you approach the first tee, you encounter a converted stable that will soon be the pro shop - perfectly appropriate for a course named Old Macdonald. You then see an enormous putting green - also perfectly appropriate. You begin on what Tom Doak calls \'My favorite opening hole we\'ve ever built.\' It\'s called \'Double Plateau,\' a tribute to Macdonald masterworks such as the 11th at National Golf Links and the 17th at Yale. The driving zone is gigantic, which sets the tone for the rest of the round. There\'s a ton of room to accommodate strategic driving, as well as the gale-force winds that frequently blow through this exposed site. Your tee shots may sail well off target, but it\'s going to be hard to lose a ball.\r\nOld Macdonald sports more ocean views than its sibling, Bandon Trails, but fewer than Pacific and Bandon Dunes. It also boasts surprising elevation change - some huge ups and downs - yet it\'s so skillfully routed, it\'s a comfortable walk. The massive dune ridges, dotted with the most incredible gorse collection I\'ve ever seen, blazing a brilliant sea of yellow in late April, are remarkable, as are the formalized bunkers. Of course, what may stick with you the most are some of the largest greens in creation, complete with rolls and plateaus and backstops of every description. Again, like the rest of the course, they\'re wild, but manageable - and relentlessly interesting.\r\nRead more of Travelin\' Joe\'s first impressions of Old Macdonald\r\n14 Hours, 21.7 Miles, 2 Barking Dogs: Alan Shipnuck\'s marathon day at Bandon Dunes.\r\nFor more information, go to ban','888-345-6008','','','','','','','','57744 Round Lake Drive Bandon, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed530e25-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 97411 ','Resort','Tom Doak/Jim Urbina','2010','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','$75 - $275','Yes','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','',0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('495f298c-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','BANDON CROSSINGS GOLF COURSE','\'Bandon on a budget\' best describes this low-key layout that will attract golfers on the strength of its magical name alone. While the course has no affiliation with the Bandon Dunes Resort, it does offer a bucolic, affordable, cart-friendly alternative to its more spectacular namesakes twenty minutes to the north. Designed by Oregon native Dan Hixson and shaped by Tony Russell, whose crew worked on Bandon Dunes, this inland track plays up, down and around a dry river bottomland. Majestic coastal trees, classically sculpted bunkers and uneven terrain provide the main challenges. The memorable fifth hole is a 545-yard, creek-guarded, par-5, it\'s green some 70 feet below the tee. For walkers who wish to avoid the arduous trek up and down the bottomlands, there is an alternate par-4 green that reduces the 5th to 410 yards. From there, walkers proceed to the 15th hole and finish out the nine. It\'s not Bandon Dunes, but if aching legs and wallet woes are getting you down, this is a refreshing, natural-looking substitute and well worth every penny.','541-347-3232','','','','','','','','87530 Dew Valley Lane Bandon,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed530e25-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 97411 ','Public','Dan Hixson','2007','Bent Grass','Winter Rye','Yes','51-60','Sprinkler Heads Marked','33 - 93','Yes','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Mark Fiore',1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('495fbca2-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','YWCA HUECO CONFERENCE & RECREATION CENTER GOLF','This course is used exclusively by the YWCA employees, members and guests.

His worldwide portfolio is impressive, but Tetherow is the place he calls home.\r\nTwo years ago we named Tetherow Golf Club in Bend, Oregon, the \'Best New Course You Can Play,\' but there was one caveat: you had to play it soon, because it was going private. Public-access golfers can thank the slump in real estate sales for keeping the gate open to all.\r\nIf you\'re a fan of cleverly -- some might say fiendishly -- contoured greens, links-style fairway turf and glorious mountain panoramas, Tetherow is your kind of place. Kidd\'s ambitious layout is draped across two different ridgelines in view of nine mountain peaks. While the scenery is sublime, the challenges are relentless, primarily in the form of fast-running fairways that demand ground-game prowess and a set of dramatically contoured greens that will vex, amuse and frustrate even the most skilled putters.\r\nOnce you battle through the dramatic, 182-yard 17th, which plays to a dry island green, and the risk/reward 588-yard 18th, the bargain replay rate of $60 will lure you right back to the fight.','866-234-4848','','','','','','','','61240 Skyline Ranch Rd \r\nBend,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed530e25-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 97702 ','Public',' David McLay Kidd ','2008','Not Available','Not Available ','Not Available ','Not Available ','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.',' $99 - $145 ','Yes','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area ','',0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('49a0a62c-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','ELDORADO GOLF CLUB','This course is located in a small community of 2,100 people.

The lodge and courses are located in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. These courses, which are about three miles apart, but are part of the same resort, were built on a chain of open meadows and are very hilly. The Big Meadow Course has flatter terrain and is longer and more open than the Glaze Meadow Course. In other words, the Glaze Meadow Course requires more placement shots. There are dogleg fairways to test your ability to work the ball in both directions. \'Golf Digest\' rated the Big Meadow Course as the 7th \'Best Public Course\' in the state for 1996. In addition, the Glaze Meadow Course was rated by \'Golf Digest\' as the 54th best out of \'America\'s Top 75 Affordable Courses\' from their list of \'America\'s Best Golf Courses Everyone Can Play\' for 1996. They also rated it as the 12th \'Best in State\' course for 1997-98. The Superintendent for the Glaze Meadow Course is Jerry Kessell. For tee times reservations call (800) 399-2322.

It is laid out in a gently rolling valley of black, sticky clay, and the entire course was veneered with six inches of sand to enhance drainage. There is also plenty of sand in the form of directional and strategic bunkering. Many of the bunkers are placed well forward of the landing areas and well short of the sizable greens, creating optical illusions. The front nine weaves clockwise around a broad plain; the back nine loops through more challenging, elevated terrain. Among the more difficult holes is #5, a short par 4, with a narrow fairway where the target is a tiny plateau with a false front that falls off steeply in back. Without a doubt, the most dramatic hole is #16, a 591-yard, par 5, where the tee shot heads straight into the backdrop of snow-peaked Mount McLoughlin. The roller-coaster fairway tumbles downhill to meet a lake on the right side. Robert Trent Jones, Jr. is listed as the designer, builder, owner, and operator of this course. The restaurant and clubhouse will be finished at a later date.','541-826-8225','','','','','','','','100 Eagle Point Dr Eagle Point,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed530e25-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 97524-9696 ','Public','Robert Trent Jones, Jr.','1996','Bent Grass','Bermuda Grass',' Yes ','61-70','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$40.00 - $48.00','N/A ','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Tony Galvin',1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('4c5e6f0b-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','SHADY OAKS COUNTRY CLUB','This private club\'s exceptional course is a place where local knowledge is extremely helpful.

This 18-hole championship course opened October 2000, measures 7,005 yards from the back tees, and plays to a par of 72. The course was originaly designed by professional-golfer-turned-architect Greg Norman, but when the course changed ownership it was redesigned by architect Jay Morrish. Constructed on a former Texas cattle ranch, the course follows the natural contours of the property, maximizing natural features while minimizing drastic topographical changes. In simpler terms, little or no dirt was moved during construction. This translates to a \'linksy\' course that is challenging yet playable, while maintaining a standard of risk/reward. There are three par 4\'s under 315 yards, 2 par 5\'s under 520 yards, and one par 5 under 621 yards. The fairways follow the many tree-lined creeks that wind through the land, and although 15 holes have water in play, water can be seen from all 18. Five sets of tees will accommodate a variety of handicaps. Yardages are indicated by stone monuments, fairway plates, and each cart has a yardage book. Discount packages vary by season. A hotel located on the property is scheduled to open late 2001.

The par is 46 for players between the ages of 9 and 12, the par is 64 for those under 9. The course has a variety of trees that can affect tee shots, but there are no water hazards. This is an excellent course for adults to walk, as well as work on their short game.

In Scotland, some golf links are built upon land reclaimed from the sea. The Pacific Ocean and Siletz Bay line the majority of the northwest corner of this course. Water hazards come into play on five holes. The rugged and natural beauty of the terrain combined with all the weather elements will provide even the best golfer with a challenging round. Locals say that this course has been created in harmony with nature. The trees and coastal vegetation surrounding the areas of play are left as natural as possible. As on Scottish-links courses, the tee boxes, landing areas and greens are well-maintained. The forest and brush on the sides of the fairways will make finding an errant ball almost impossible. Hitting straight shots is important when playing this course. Many of the greens are mounded, making shot placement all the more vital. Due to the pine tree formations, there are many dogleg fairways that require players to use caution or find themselves looking at possible double bogies. The well-bunkered greens also add to the difficulty. There are discounted rates available from June through October. In 1996, they completed the first phase of a renovation that includes an irrigation system, several fairways, sand bunkers, and entirely redesigned holes by architect Bill Robinson. Robert Muir Graves had previously redesigned the course in the 1980s. The men\'s tee also has a ladies\' course rating of 77.0 and a slope rating of 134.

The Slick Rock Course is the oldest of the courses and the most friendly. The fairways tend to be wide, with large, shady oaks and bunkers defining the turns. The greens, totally rebuilt in 1997 at a cost of $4 million, are large and undulating. The signature hole on Slick Rock is #14, a 361-yard, par 4, which crosses a wide river with lily pads and a roaring waterfall. The Ram Rock Course is the toughest of the three, and every hole has interesting features. Hole #4, a 191-yard, par 3, features an island green. Water comes into play on eleven holes in all on the Ram Rock Course. The Apple Rock Course is nearly as challenging as Ram Rock, but is far more forgiving from the regular tees. The best aspect of this course are the distant views from the elevated tees, the attractive ponds, and the boulders set on end that serve as 150-yard markers. These courses, which are located in the Texas hill country, host the State Amateur and qualifying rounds for the PGA School\'s first stage. \'GOLF Magazine\' ranked the Apple Rock Course 83rd among the \'Top 100 Courses You Can Play\' in the U.S. for 1996. The Slick Rock Course was selected by \'Golf Digest\' as the 11th \'Best in State\' course for 1997-98. The same publication afforded the Ram Rock Course 40th among \'Top 75 Resort Courses\' for 1992, and rated it the 6th \'Best in State\' course for 1995-96. In addition, \'GOLF Magazine\' ranked the Ram Rock Course 79th among the \'Top 100 Courses You Can Play,\' in the U.S. for 1998.

The non-adjoining dogleg fairways, in conjunction with a multitude of sand bunkers, add to the overall difficulty of this course. Numerous water hazards have also been incorporated into the design. The terrain is hilly, resulting in many uneven lies.\r\nMeadows: Redesigned in 1999 by John Fought, this new layout features a good variety within its 18 holes, seven of which border the meandering Sun River. The dramatic use of directional and forebunkers serve up ample challenges for golfers of all skill levels. In addition, the course was lengthened to more than 7,000 yards and was changed from a par 72 to a par 71.\r\nCrosswater: The newest course at the facility, Crosswater Course, is one of the longest courses in the U.S. The course is highlighted by the Deschutes and Little Deschutes Rivers that come into play on seven holes. The design was built among meadow, forest and carefully preserved swamp. One of the most outstanding holes is #12, a 687-yard, par 5, which has a lake in play and provides a beautiful view of Mount Bachelor. GOLF MAGAZINE ranked it 47th among the \'Top 100 Courses You Can Play\' in the U.S. for 2002.

The Bridges Course is the newest nine hole design, offering fast, undulating Floradwarf greens and fairly wide fairways. The layout of this course creates a multitude of situations where golfers must decide on whether to play in a risky manner or to make conservative, safer shots. One of the best holes on the Bridges Course is #3, a 427-yard, par 4, featuring a three-level fairway that hides the green from the first level, the water hazard protecting the green on the second level, and then finally allows golfers to see the entire layout of the hole\'s finish from the third level. The Creek Course is not as long as the Bridges, but it is narrower and has more water coming into play. The signature hole on the Creek is #8, a 208-yard, par 3, incorporating an elevated tee box, a creek that runs along the right side and a green with a ridge in the middle and sand bunkers protecting the right and left sides. The Bunkers Course lives up to its name by including many sand hazards into the design. Hole #1, a 417-yard, par 4, is considered the toughest starting hole in Texas. The tee shot must avoid a large sand bunker without carrying over the bunker because this will put the ball in a lake. Even if the tee shot stays away from these initial hazards, the second shot must still be carried 175 to 200 yards over water. The club hosted the Independent Insurance Agents Junior Classic in 1999, which is an invitational tournament for the top 180 junior golfers in the nation. Past participants have included many well known tour professionals, such as Tiger Woods.\r\n\r\nThis Club has multiple courses:\r\n\r\n    Creek/Bunkers\r\n    Bunkers/Bridges\r\n    Bridges/Creek.','(281) 444 5302 ','','','','','','','','17110 Northgate Forest Dr\r\nHouston, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed8c9fbe-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 77068-1499 ','Private','Bruce Devlin & Robert von Hagge','1984','Tifdwarf Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','51-60','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.','$55.00 - $65.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Bill Craig',1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('580c167f-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','OAK HILLS GOLF CLUB','This links-style course was built on rolling terrain.

The first hole reminds you more of a links-style design with the hole being very open. Starting with the second hole you will find the remains of a Filbert orchard along the sides of the fairways, which will come into play if you hook or slice your ball. On the back nine you will find more of the open or link-style designed holes. The front nine has three par 3\'s and three par 5\'s, with a total par for the course of 72. Some of the fairways are quite narrow, and the greens vary in size. There is some change of elevation on the course, such as hole #7, where a downhill tee shot is needed and then an uphill approach shot. There is water in play on several holes and several environmental sensitive or marsh areas, which you will find on the sides of the fairways or which become part of the design of the hole, requiring you to cross them on your way to the green. A good example of this is hole #14, which is one of their signature holes. This hole, a 500-yard, par 5, has a dogleg left fairway that calls for an approach shot over one of the environmental areas to an elevated green. There are two more signature-type holes, #4 and #17. Hole #4, a 491-yard, par 5, starts off with water on the right and the tee shot is straight ahead towards a fluffy light-green tree. You have a lot more room to the tree than it appears, at least 250 yards. From there your second shot is uphill over a creek towards the 150-yard marker.

But back then, the course worked better for routing galleries than it did as an aesthetically pleasing, cohesive test of golf.\r\n\r\nToday, thanks to a number of helpful tweaks by Champions Tour player D.A. Weibring, the TPC has become a really fun track. The hardest par on the course has always been the par-4 3rd, which now measures 528 yards and has water on the right. The best hole has always been the 406-yard, par-4 14th, which demands a perfectly placed drive followed by an approach over water, with bunker and tree trouble lurking on both shots. But probably the most thrilling change is Weibring\'s redo of the 198-yard 17th, with its amphitheater green complex flush against a lake.\r\n\r\nAs for the hotel: The Four Seasons Resort and Club Dallas at Las Colinas may be a mouthful, but this Silver Medal winner in our Premier Resorts Awards is an excellent urban retreat.\r\n\r\nThe property is close to the DFW airport and downtown Dallas, but it still offers \'resort-getaway\' ambience along with the typical Four Seasons touches. The whole package feels like a luxurious business hotel blended with an exclusive country club.\r\n\r\nUnique among the amenities is the hotel\'s amazing sports club ? Dallas\'s finest ? with tennis, squash, indoor and outdoor pools, running tracks, and half-court basketball. At times, golf almost feels like an afterthought ? but it really shouldn\'t. Not anymore, at least.\r\n\r\nThis Club has multiple courses:\r\n\r\n    TPC\r\n    Cottonwood Valley.','(972) 717 2530 ','','','','','','','','4150 N MacArthur Blvd\r\nIrving','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed8c9fbe-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 75038-6417 ','Resort','Jay Morrish/D.A.

He stomped door-to-door campaigning for a municipal golf course in Anaheim. In December of 1970, at age 93, he earned his first hole-in-one on hole #11, a 107-yard, par 3, and a few years later, \'Anaheim Municipal Golf Course\' was renamed in his honor. There is one lake that comes into play on at least two holes, and numerous trees line the fairways. If you drive the ball well, you can reach some of the par 4\'s in one shot, but the fairways can be tight at times and out-of-bounds stakes line some holes. One of the hardest holes on this course is #17, a long par 5, which measures more than 600 yards. The greens are undulating and have average speed. In addition, quite a few sand bunkers have been spread throughout the course\'s design, but they mainly come into play around the greens. This is an excellent location to bring the entire family. The course\'s 24-hour tee time reservation number is (714) 748-8900. Nine hole green fees are in effect after noon; weekend green fees are in effect on Friday.','714-765-3481','','','','','','','','430 N Gilbert StAnaheim, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 92801-5098 ','Public','Dick Miller','1961','Bent Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','41-50','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$23.00 - $32.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Roger Teel',1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('5b3bf2af-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','ANAHEIM HILLS GOLF COURSE','This is one of the most hilly and undulating public courses in Orange County. This course was built on rolling hills, but the fairways are primarily level. Seven of the narrow, tree-lined fairways are doglegs, providing for many blind shots to the greens if your tee shots aren\'t well placed. Many of the fairways have out-of-bounds stakes along the sides. A creek comes into play on some holes, and a lake guards three sides of the green on hole #13. The most scenic hole on the course is #13, a 207-yard, par 3, with a view of the entire course and surrounding terrain. Another notable hole is #15, a 366-yard, par 4, with an equally scenic view of the course and requiring golfers to tee off from an elevated tee, measuring over four stories in height. Hole #17, a 164-yard, par 3, requires a tee shot from a box forty feet above the green. This course\'s greens vary in size, undulation, and at times speed, depending on the direction your putting in regard to the hilly terrain. The facility constructed sixteen new covered stalls for its driving range, along with new mats and balls, in 1996. Their 24-hour tee time reservation line is (714) 765-4653.

Mature pine and oak trees line each of the narrow fairways. Although there are no water hazards (with the exception of a flood control channel that play as out-of bounds), there are many strategically-placed sand bunkers. Additionally, this course\'s large greens are sloped. One of the most difficult holes on the course is #18, a 435-yard, par 4, which requires a massive tee shot over some large mounds up a dogleg right fairway, then a long approach shot to the green.

Award after award has been showered on this course, designed by Keith Foster, on a site that lies in the gorgeous Sierra Nevada foothills. Now as we begin 2008, we are more committed than ever to upholding the quality of our beautiful course, and the heartfelt service to our clients that has made DarkHorse a \'must play\' destination for golfers everywhere. Golf Magazine chose DarkHorse as one of its Top 10 You Can Play in America. The Sacramento Bee voted the club as its No. 1 course to play in the Sacramento area within six months of our opening. This is no course designed in an office thousands of miles away from its location. Foster laid out DarkHorse on the site to create a handcrafted masterpiece that lovers of the game will want to play again and again to challenge their strategic thinking, risk-taking and shot-making skills. But it\'s more than just the game that draws players to DarkHorse. Our course blends into the natural harmony of the foothills landscape - a mixture of golden hills studded with oak trees and canyons brimming with fragrant pine trees. To keep this site at its pristine best, a minimum of earth was moved to create this 7,096-yard, par-72 course. The holes and greens were classically sculptured to fit the gently rolling terrain.','530-269-7900','','','','','','','','24150 Darkhorse Drive\r\nAuburn, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 95602-8917 ','Public','Keith Foster','0','Bent Grass','Bent Grass','Yes','71-80','Electronic Range System','$59.00 - $79.00','Yes','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Geno Ivaldi, Matt Soza',1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('5d6ec5c6-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','BAY FOREST GOLF COURSE ','This course has large, well-bunkered greens.

It was designed by Tom Doak, who did what many have done in oil-rich Texas: He dug a hole in search of something special. To compensate for a featureless landscape, Doak excavated a 268-acre cotton field and used the dirt to build a 15-foot high backdrop around the course. He then sculpted wide, rolling fairways, mounds and sidehill lies seldom seen in the Texas prairies. Doak\'s 182-yard 10th hole was inspired by the 11th at St. Andrews. Other holes echo Royal County Down and Royal Melbourne. The 476-yard 8th hole, which Doak says is among his toughest, becomes an unofficial par 5 when the wind is in your face. The 7,207-yard course is named for Tech alumnus Jerry S. Rawls, who donated $8.6 million for the project. Built below ground level, this track is too special to stay under your radar. -excerpt from the article \'Top Ten You Can Play,\' GOLF MAGAZINE, February 2004.','806-742-4653','','','','','','','','Box 42004\r\nLubbock','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed8c9fbe-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 79409-2004','Public','Tom Doak','0','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','38 - 46','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area, Golf School.','',1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('5f047853-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','PGA OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AT OAK VALLEY','The PGA of Southern California Golf Club at Oak Valley is a public daily fee facility boasting two exceptional championship 18-hole courses, both designed by Lee Schmidt and Brian Curley.

The Champions is an 18-hole championship track designed in a more traditional parkland style.

The longest 6,290 yards in golf opens with four consecutive uphill holes tucked snugly between homes, followed by the bizarre 5th, a unique, Z-shaped par-5 that calls for a layup drive and likely a blind second that avoids a working ranch.\r\n\r\nThereafter, Bodega Harbour is all great fun -- and thanks to its misty, breezy summer weather, foghorn blasts and stunning ocean views, it\'s a true touch of Old World golf an hour north of the Golden Gate Bridge. Robert Trent Jones Jr. crafted nine holes here in 1976 and nine more in 1987, but what\'s new in 2009 is everything else. Significantly, Bodega added bunkers, pushing the number to more than 100, yet reconfigured them so that they\'re smaller, shallower and more strategically placed. Most notably, new bentgrass greens replace the old poa putting surfaces, resulting in some of the finest, fastest greens around. For pure flatstick challenge, Bodega Harbour rocks. Just mind the diving pelicans. They looked like they were auditioning for a sequel.','707-875-3538','','','','','','','','21301 Heron Dr\r\nBodega Bay, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 94923 ','Semi-Private','Robert Trent Jones, Jr.','1977','Poa Annua Grass','Bent Grass','Yes','91-100','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.','$45.00 - $90.00','N/A','Putting Green','Bob Caldwell',1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('600f8b9b-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','MCALLEN COUNTRY CLUB','This club has an outstanding eighteen hole course.

The course has three separate looks. Cut into a portion of existing rocky terrain, three holes have a definite Arizona feel. Another trio of holes is reminiscent of East Texas, with piney woods and rolling hills. The remaining three holes have an open links-style feel. Green play is fast and deceptive, with an array of tricky breaks. Repetitive play is required before mastering the greens. Overall, the course plays uphill and downhill, requiring a variety of shots. Over 1,000 pines have been added to existing vegetation. The course\'s signature hole is #4, a 164-yard, par 3, which resembles a miniature #16 at Augusta. Water protects the green\'s front side. To carry the water, a tee shot of at least 150 yards is necessary.','903-572-1288','','','','','','','','Hwy 67\r\nMt Pleasant','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed8c9fbe-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 75455 ','Public','Ken Smith','1997','Bermuda Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','11--20','No Yardage Markers','$10.00 - $15.00','N/A','Putting Green, Chipping Area','',1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('6105bcf3-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','BREA GOLF COURSE','This course features a creek flowing through its entire design and it comes into play on many holes.

Brackenridge Park Golf Course reopened in October 2008 after a one-year facelift.\r\n\r\nConveniently located on the edge of downtown San Antonio, this 1916 A.W. Tillinghast design was remade by architect John Colligan and design associate Trey Kemp -- with spectacular results. In its heyday from the twenties through the fifties, Brackenridge periodically played host to the PGA Tour\'s Texas Open, and winners here included legends like Walter Hagen, Byron Nelson and Sam Snead. It was also at Brackenridge that Mike Souchak broke the Tour scoring record, firing a 27-under-par 257 in 1955.\r\n\r\nToday, the 6,263-yard, par-71 layout won\'t induce fear in most golfers, but it is still a joy to play. A slightly revised back nine routing skirts the San Antonio River, while ancient Tilly touches were brought back -- like a half-dozen squarish greens and classic flat-bottom bunkers. This is one history lesson even the most disaffected student will enjoy.','210-226-5612','','','','','','','','2315 Ave B\r\nSan Antonio,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed8c9fbe-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 78215-1092 ','Public','A.W.

The layout provides great scenery, excellent conditions, and a fair amount of difficulty. The difficulty comes from the many uphill and downhill shots that are required due to the many changes in elevation. In addition, the natural vegetation that lines the fairways will add strokes to anyone who strays that way. The undulating greens are very large, fast, and extremely difficult to read. Several tee boxes and greens are elevated. The fairways are fairly wide open, but there is still a definite advantage in keeping your shots straight. Water hazards come into play on six holes. One of the prettiest holes is #3, a 149-yard, par 3, which requires a tee shot to a green that is protected by water in the front and sand bunkers in the back. This green is very difficult to two putt, particularly if the tee is back left. \'GOLF Magazine\' ranked Aviara 80th among the \'Top 100 Courses You Can Play in the U.S.\' for 1998.','760-603-6900','','','','','','','','7447 Batiquitos Dr\r\nCarlsbad, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 92009-4732 ','Resort','Arnold Palmer & Ed Seay','1991','Bent Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','51-60','200, 150, 100 Yrd Sprinkler Heads & Kirby Markers.','$215 - $235','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area, Golf School.','Bill Crist',1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('63fced07-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','WOODLAKE GOLF CLUB','','210-661-6124','','','','','','','','6500 Woodlake Parkway\r\nSan Antonio','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed8c9fbe-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 78244','Public','','0','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','$15 - $41','N/A','None','',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('64050960-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','LA COSTA RESORT & SPA','This full-service luxury resort is situated on 400 rolling acres of scenic terrain and has been named the \'Best Spa in the World\' by The Robb Report.

The terrain is fairly flat, but some of the tees and greens are elevated. In addition, rock-bed creeks (generally dry) cross the fairways in front of the greens. All the rock creeks come into play on the back nine and are marked on the scorecard\'s hole diagrams. Watch out for them on holes #12, #15, #17, and #18. Furthermore, four holes on the front nine have water hazards in play. Unless you\'ve played the course a few times before, the medium-sized greens can be hard to read because the subtle contours and breaks are difficult to perceive. Locals proclaim hole #18 as a great finishing hole. From the back tee, this 524-yard, par 5, requires a tee shot up a dogleg right fairway, then a well-positioned second shot so you can avoid the large oak tree growing on the right that can block your approach shot, and finally, an approach shot over a depression in the fairway with a rock-bed creek at its base to a green with a large sand bunker protecting its front. The course is managed by American Golf. A permanent clubhouse was completed in September, 1997. This club provides a green fee discount on weekdays and another discount on weekends to holders of the American Golf Club Card. Range balls are included with the green fee. Tees times can be reserved eight to thirty days in advance for a reservation fee.','210-545-5300','','','','','','','','1100 W Bitters Rd\r\nSan Antonio','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed8c9fbe-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 78216-7809 ','Semi-Private','Randy Heckenkemper','1996','Tifdwarf Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','31-40','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.','$65.00 - $65.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro','Rick DeLoch',1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('641d1f1f-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','RANCHO CANADA GOLF CLUB','This club has two outstanding eighteen hole courses.

The East Course starts out like a lamb, but then builds in intensity to a back nine that presents some of the most challenging holes on the peninsula. During the tour, players must conquer the river five different times, including on hole #13, a 192-yard, par 3, requiring a carry of nearly 200 yards to an elevated green that\'s cradled at the base of the Santa Lucia mountains. Hole #18, a 403-yard, par 4, is even more difficult because it\'s uphill all the way to a well-bunkered green.

Pete Dye made numerous changes in 1995 to eliminate many sand bunkers and a lot of his trademark railroad ties, making the course much more \'golfer friendly.\' Even so, there is still enough difficulty remaining with the many large sand bunkers, long, thick rough and trees in play. The back nine is particularly challenging with most of the holes built in the hills, requiring uphill and downhill shots from elevated tees to elevated greens. The greens are medium to large in size and many are tiered and undulating. Water comes into play on several holes.

La Cantera has been ranked one of the best resorts in America by Golf Magazine.\r\n\r\nThe Resort course\'s design includes natural water hazards -- including streams and waterfalls -- which come into play. Six holes offer panoramic views of the San Antonio area and many fairways are lined with oak trees. Seventy white-sand bunkers are spread throughout the course\'s design.\r\n\r\nThe 316-yard, par-4 seventh hole is called \'The Rattler\' and features a unique rattlesnake-shaped sand bunker on the left side of the fairway, along with several other fairway bunkers you\'ll need to avoid. Your tee shot is hit from a cliff 80 feet above the fairway with a great view of the roller coaster at Six Flags and many of the other amusement park rides in the distance. This course has hosted the PGA Tour\'s Texas Open several times.\r\n\r\nOpened in March 2001, the Palmer Course is the latest addition to the La Cantera Resort. Palmer\'s fifth course is just over 7,000 yards long. The signature hole is the par-3 fourth, featuring dramatic waterfalls running along the entire front of the green and the Winnie Palmer Memorial Bridge.\r\n\r\nThis Club has multiple courses:\r\n\r\n    Resort\r\n    Palmer Course.','800-446-5387','','','','','','','','16401 La Cantera Pkwy\r\nSan Antonio,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed8c9fbe-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 78256-2400','Public','Tom Weiskopf & Jay Morrish','1995','Bermuda Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','71-80','Sprinkler Heads Marked','$125.00 - $140.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area, Golf School.','Donald DeMasters',1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('64894a9a-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','TEHAMA GOLF CLUB','This private course is owned by actor/director Clint Eastwood.','831-622-2250','','','','','','','','101 Via Malpaso\r\nCarmel Valley, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 93923-9688 ','Private','Jay Morrish','1999','Bent Grass','Bent Grass','Yes','1--10','Sprinkler Heads Marked','$0.00 - $0.00','No','None','Rick Leibovich',1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('64930fda-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','CANYON SPRINGS GOLF CLUB','','210-497-1770','','','','','','','','24405 Wilderness Oak\r\nSan Antonio','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed8c9fbe-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 78260 ','Public','','0','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','$55 - $90','N/A','Putting Green','',0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('649e9fdc-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','ANCIL HOFFMAN GOLF COURSE','Ancil Hoffman is fairly flat with few water hazards.

This course is not exactly a target course because it allows for mistakes, but ponds do come into play on a few holes. The Lakeview Course is a target course, forcing the golfer to hit over numerous hazards to small landing areas. Water hazards come into play on every hole. The Mountainview Course is also a position course. The fairways have some hills that can cause uneven lies, but they are mostly flat. The signature hole is #7 on the Mountainview Course.

In 1994, the city invested over $5 million dollars to completely renovate the course\'s design. This project was led by architect Gerald W. Pirkl. This once flat course now has large mounds and moguls coming into play on every hole. Four new lakes have been added to the design, they come into play on seven holes. All the narrow fairways are lined by large mature pine trees and bordered by a standard cut of rough. The greens have been completely redesigned. Instead of the once small and hard-surfaced greens of the past, the course now has large, slightly undulating greens that are soft enough to hold your shots. Good course management during the front nine holes is a must if you wish to shoot a low score. This course has two outstanding holes finishing off each nine. Hole #9, a 416-yard, par 4, requires a tee shot to a small landing area guarded by a lake on the left and huge mounds on the right, then an approach shot to a green that is protected by several large white-sand bunkers. Hole #18, a 424-yard, par 4, requires a long tee shot, then an approach shot to a green that has a large tree blocking approach shots from the left and out-of-bounds stakes on the right. The 5,657-yard men\'s tee also has a ladies\' course rating of 72.5 and a slope of 124. The 6,030-yard men\'s tee also has a ladies\' course rating of 74.6 and a slope of 128.

With fifteen dogleg, tree-lined fairways, shot placement is much more critical off the tee than yardage. The fairways are gently contoured and, with only a moderate cut of rough, are relatively forgiving. While the greens vary in size, they are all heavily undulating, including hole #5, a 429-yard, par 4, which plays uphill and through an alley of trees.

All three courses are scenic because they possess wild flowers and an abundance of wildlife. The Pine Glen Course, a par 3 course, is excellent for beginners. The Oak Glen Course and the Willow Glen Course play very much the same. The fairways are tree lined and narrow, and the undulating greens are medium in size and speed. There are ponds and a riverbed that come into play on all three courses. Each course is traditionally designed. Several holes on the Oak Glen Course were redesigned in 1995. As a result, the course plays longer and is now a par 72. The club offers special twilight rates and golf packages. The Singing Hills Golf School, located on site, offers golf lessons. This course is also home to The School of Golf for Women, which was one of the first of its kind, and the local LPGA Girls Golf Club. The senior discount is only valid for the Pine Glen Course.

The tree-lined fairways are somewhat open, and the greens are large. The terrain is basically flat and easy to walk. Most holes play straightaway, with the exception of #17, a 504-yard, par 5, where the fairway doglegs to the left. There are three ponds on the course, but only the one on hole #4 is really in play. The greens are average speed. Holes 14-17 have been recently redesigned, and the remaining 14 holes will follow shortly. The Classic Course underwent a $750,000 remodel in 2001 and reopened spring 2002. The Players course is the latest addition to Mile Square. It measures just under 7,000 yards from the back tees and plays to a par of 72. The course features rolling fairways, undulating greens and several new lakes. A new clubhouse has been constructed at Mile Square, and it includes a pro-shop, restaurant, bar, snack bar and banquet space.','714-968-4556','','','','','','','','10401 Warner Ave\r\nFountain Valley, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 92708-1604 ','Public','Harry & David Rainville','1962','Bent Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','81-90','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$43.00 - $52.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro','Kevin Barry',1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('71a01e7c-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','DAVID L.

For example, the signature hole #8, a 205-yard, par 3, requires a tee shot over a canyon that must carry 180 yards to a green protected by a large sand bunker on its right. Another spectacular hole is #7, a 403-yard, par 4, requiring a tee shot from off a cliff approximately 100 yards above the fairway, and then an approach shot over a creek to the green. In addition, creeks cross fairways on several other holes. The greens are large, undulating, and fairly fast. This course is managed by American Golf. The green fees indicated are good for tee times reserved seven days in advance. Tee times can be reserved up to forty-five days in advance with an additional charge. There are discounted fees before 8 AM and after 3 PM. Weekend green fees are also in effect Fridays and holidays.','714-672-6800','','','','','','','','1440 E Bastanchury\r\nFullerton, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 92835-2822 ','Public','Cal Olson','1996','Bent Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','41-50','Sprinkler Heads Marked','$75.00 - $95.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Jamie Mulligan',1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('73134a91-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','LANSFORD COUNTRY CLUB','This wide open course features generous fairways, and the artificial grass greens are medium-sized and fast.

The course was built by Fairways Architects. \'Golf Digest\' rated this course as the10th \'Best Public Course\' in the state for 1996. There are only nine holes here, but by switching the tee boxes and directions that you approach the greens, the club is able to create two different layouts. There is an eighty-foot wide river that you must carry six different times during your round. The course is heavily wooded with numerous 200-year-old oak trees. The fairways are narrow, and the very large greens were built to handle play from two different directions. Sand and grass bunkers are spread throughout the entire course.

Because of the five holes that play along a cliff above the ocean and provide great views, the course has been referred to as the \'poor man\'s Pebble Beach.\' Holes #10, a 381-yard, par 4 and #11, a 224-yard, par 3, are particularly interesting and enjoyable to play. Hole #10 has a downhill, dogleg left fairway with the Pacific Ocean providing the background for the green. On hole #11 you tee off from a cliff that is about eighty feet above the green, again with the ocean in back of the green. The fairways are fairly open with some trees in play if you get off the fairways. There are several holes that play uphill or downhill from the tee. The greens are medium to large in size and are sloped but not very undulated. Most of the greens and tees are elevated. The only water in play is on hole #18, a 174-yard, par 3, where you tee off from a cliff, over a lake, to the green below. The final stage of the PGA Tour\'s qualifying round was played at the course in 1996. Friday is included in the weekend green fee rates. Kenneth H. Hunter, Jr. developed this course, along with Hunter Ranch in Paso Robles and La Purisima Golf Course in Lompoc. All three courses have received recognition as outstanding courses.

Stark cliffsides, ocean views, treeless, linksy terrain -- wow! When I played it the next year, my reaction turned to \'ouch!\' Fog obscured vistas until round\'s end, the front nine was pure side-by-side hard-hat areas and the anticipated firm, links-like conditions proved a fantasy. The course played as soft and wet as any other regular NorCal course.\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to 2009. What a difference a decade makes. Hey, weather can still be a factor, and the front nine is still pretty tight, but everything else about the Ocean course -- and the entire Half Moon Bay experience -- is superb. Admittedly, the rooms, service and amenities at the on-site Ritz-Carlton Half Moon Bay are so good that you might enjoy the golf experience even if they forgot to insert the flagsticks that morning. Sipping a California Pinot, or perhaps a single malt, around the Ritz\' fire pit and gazing out at the crashing waves, will cure whatever\'s ailing you.\r\n\r\nThat said, the golf now holds its own. OK, I\'m not sure that the Old course, a 1973 Arnold Palmer/Frank Duane parkland design, is all that memorable, except for the all-world par-4 18th. (Of course, history\'s greatest wide receiver, Jerry Rice, told me he prefers the Old over the Ocean, but I\'ll counter that Jerry took one too many hard hits in the secondary to arrive at that conclusion.)\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the Arthur Hills-designed Ocean course has never looked or played better. New management has committed to making the course play firm and fast, like a classic links. Green surrounds have been shaved and sanded, providing more ground game options. Natural contouring now plays a huge role in where your ball ends up. They\'ve also cut back fairway rough, which cuts down on bad lies and searching for balls, thus speeding up play.

The course is situated in the foothills of the Hemet Valley, and there are spectacular views of the San Jacinto Mountains throughout the property. The gently rolling fairways are relatively wide open, with very few trees to obstruct shots. However, several holes are lined with tall fescue on this \'links meets the mountains\' style course, calling for accurate shotmaking and proper club selection. As Hemet plays into the foothills the elevation changes, making for some interesting shots. The bentgrass greens are all generally large and challenging to putt. Bunkering is not extensive and water comes into play on six holes. The course at Hemet Golf Club plays from 5,260 to 6,590-yards, and there are four sets of tees available.

This course has lots to offer for the amateur to seasoned pro.','951-767-0828','','','','','','','','31220 Sage Rd\r\nHemet,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 92543 ','Public','Bill Martin','1999','Bermuda Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','41-50','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$30.00 - $40.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Greg Williamson',0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('76a7a141-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','BOIS DE SIOUX GOLF COURSE','This course has holes located in two different states, North Dakota and Minnesota.

This course was redesigned after a flood and boasts greens that are praised for their great putting surfaces. The signature hole, #9, a 497-yard, par 5, is reminiscent of #13 at Augusta National.

Bell Jr. In the late 1950s and early 1960s the course at Hesperia was a PGA tour stop. Now this course is a well known U.S. Open Qualifying site. California Golfer magazine has named Hesperia one of the top 20 toughest courses in the state. The narrow, gently rolling fairways play to large, challenging greens. The course is noted for its \'long and strong\' par 4s. The most difficult hole is #18, a 444-yard, par 4, requiring a shot to an elevated green. This course plays from 6,136 to 6,996-yards and there are three sets of tees to accomodate all skill levels.

A ravine cuts into the fairway from the right side 240 yards off the tee, and follows the left side of the fairway up to the green. The Gabilan Course is flatter and longer, and has seen plenty of tournament action from some of the best golfers in the world. In 1996 and 1997, this course was used as a qualifier for the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am event. There\'s a lot of homes on this course, which means a lot of out-of-bounds areas.

The golf course was on display during the 2007 LG Skins Game, which will be hosted at Indian Wells Golf Resort through 2009.\r\n\r\nThe Players Course was conceived in the spirit of a classic American design-style with traditional rectangular tee boxes, wide playing corridors and sculpted bunkers reminiscent of Riviera, Bel-Air and the golf courses created by legendary George C. Thomas.\r\n\r\nJohn Fought and Clive Clark, designers of the Players and Celebrity Courses respectively, were able to seamlessly integrate many of the stately trees found on the original property into their new designs to impart the unique feel of an older venerable facility while at the same time delivering a modern approach to golf course design. No roads or homes intrude into either golf course.\r\n\r\nThe IW Club has a 5,000 square-foot golf shop, indoor Callaway Performance Center, sports bar and grill, fine dining, meeting space, grand lobby and more.','760-346-4653','','','','','','','','44500 Indian Wells Ln\r\nIndian Wells,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 92210-8746 ','Resort','Clive Clark','2006','Tifeagle','Bermuda Grass','Yes','91-100','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.','$120.00 - $155.00','Yes','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','',1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('776fb2e2-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','WILLISTON COUNTRY CLUB','The land this golf course was built on is owned by the Core of Engineers.

Both courses are well manicured, and the Mountain Course has been planted with beautiful flowers. The terrain on both courses varies, as their names imply. The Mountain Course is heavily bunkered. This course is well known because the Senior PGA Tour\'s Vintage Tournament had been held here for a number of years. The signature hole on the Mountain Course is #16, a 402-yard, par 4, requiring a tee shot over water to a dogleg right fairway, then an approach shot to a small green. This is a particularly beautiful hole because there are many flowers and mountain views to enjoy. \'Golf Digest\' rated the Mountain Course as the 15th \'Best in State\' course for 1995-96 and 14th for 1997-98. The Desert Course is a links-style design where most of the rough is composed of natural desert vegetation. The course has several large sand bunkers, mostly with high overhanging lips. Several of the undulating greens are double and triple-tiered. Even though hole #16, a par 3, measures only 147 yards from the back tee, it can be intimidating because it requires a tee shot over water that will drop fifty feet to the green. Another difficult par 3 is hole #5, measuring 209 yards from the back tees and also requiring a tee shot over water. However, there is room on the right to bail out if you can\'t make the distance. \'Golf Digest\' rated this as the 29th \'Best in State\' course for 1995-96.

In addition to the name change, new management has been in place and new ownership completed the first phase of a capital improvement program to elevate playability. The club has three nine hole courses that are played in three eighteen hole combinations. These courses are very difficult due to the small greens and narrow fairways. All three courses are desert-style designs, and were built on mostly flat terrain. The White/Mountain Course was built on the most rolling terrain, but there are plenty of level lies in the centers of the fairways.

The terrain is rolling, requiring many uphill shots to elevated greens and downhill shots from elevated tees. The fairways are open with the exception of eucalyptus trees on holes #13, 14 and 18. There are numerous sand bunkers on the fairways and around the greens, which become the major hazard to avoid. Many holes play right-to-left off the tees, and three of the par 3\'s have bowl-shaped greens. The other par 3, hole #12, is a very pretty hole that plays 173 yards from the championship tees and is protected by a lake on the right side. Water also comes into play on hole #9, a 500-yard, par 5, known as \'Fortitude.\' This hole requires a player to place the second shot to the left to avoid a large lake that runs along the right edge of the fairway up to the green. There are many mounds on the course and around the greens which can be used to stop your ball or be used to direct the ball to the green. The greens are very large with some undulation and tiers. The course uses the DME electronic distance system which is a hand-held device that gives you the correct yardage from where you stand to the flag. The course provides a tee location sheet each day and yardage books can be purchased from the pro shop. There are reduced green fees available for Monday and Tuesday. The weekday green fee rates shown are for Wednesday and Thursday. Fridays green fees are the same as weekend fees. Also, seniors are allowed a special green fee rate of about half the normal rate Monday through Thursday mornings.','949-653-7300','','','','','','','','1 Golf Club Rd\r\nIrvine, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 92618-5210','Public','Tom Fazio','1996','Bent Grass','Winter Rye','Yes','1--10','Kirby Marking System','$90.00 - $125.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Perry Hallmeyer',1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('78d07d1d-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','SOUTHBROOK GOLF & COUNTRY CLUB','This course is characterized by flat terrain, numerous ponds and streams, and plentiful wetland areas.

The club\'s managing partner is Doug DeCinces, who played Major League Baseball for the Baltimore Orioles and the Anaheim Angels. While requiring both distance and accuracy, the course has enough variety to bring players back time and time again. The course is set amid canyons and wetlands and offers players narrow fairways within environmental sensitive areas, and tall underbrush paralleling both sides of the fairways. A local rule provides that the environmental areas are to be treated as lateral hazards. There are many sand bunkers on the fairways and around the greens. Most greens are not leveled and have subtle undulation that require several rounds of play to figure them out. All of the golf carts are equipped with Pro Shot electronic range finders. While the club allows carts to travel on the course, many holes are roped off, requiring you to walk from the cart path to your ball. Two outstanding holes are hole #10 and hole #18. Hole #10, a 369-yard, par 4, is probably the most photographed hole. It is a dogleg left around the Sand Canyon Reservoir, with the tee area being elevated above the fairway and many sand bunkers placed along the left side of the fairway. Hole #18 is a great finishing hole. This 403-yard, par 4 requires a long tee shot to set up an approach that must carry a stream to the elevated green. This is also a very pretty hole with natural waterfalls coming down the cliff to the right of the green. The training facilities include a lighted driving range and practice center with professional instruction, a clubhouse, pro shop, dining room, bar, meeting room, and large reception and banquet facility known as \'The Barn.\'','949-551-1811','','','','','','','','11 Strawberry Farms Rd\r\nIrvine, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 92612-2300','Public','Jim Lipe','1997','Bent Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','61-70','Electronic Range System','$95.00 - $135.00','N/A','Putting Green','Alex Barretto',1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('78f2aee4-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','ALBION RIDGES GOLF COURSE','This is a very demanding course.

The large greens are full of subtle breaks, and the fairways are bordered by a standard cut of rough. If you hit an errant shot, the large trees planted alongside the fairways will come into play. This is a great location for beginning golfers who wish to take up the game, or experienced golfers who wish to work on their short game.

There are five sets of tees to accommodate a variety of handicaps, and green fees include a cart and practice balls. The wide rolling fairways wind past rock formations, large oaks, and other flora native to the Barona Indian Reservation. Water hazards consist of manmade lakes and streams, and golfers are required to tee off across these streams on several holes. There are also an number of boulders placed strategically throughout the course to challenge play.\r\n\r\nThe fairways and greens are firm and fast at this rolling tribal course that twists through rock-embedded mountain foothills 40 minutes inland from the coast. Ball control is a must at Barona, because more than 100 large, tattered-edge bunkers await sidespinning or poorly struck shots. Punch shots from the firm turf will test your recall from playing across the Pond, but the British Isles have few holes that resemble the 566-yard, par-5 17th or 472-yard, par-4 18th, each with water that spells a miserable end to a hooked shot.','619-387-7018','','','','','','','','1000 Wildcat Canyon Rd\r\nLakeside, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 92040-1546 ','Public','Todd Eckenrode','0','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','$80 - $160','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area, Golf School.\r\n','',1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('7aa8d1f7-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','PEBBLE CREEK GOLF CLUB','This club has three nine hole courses that can be combined to make three eighteen hole combinations.

In 2004, another nine holes were unveiled, with the last nine completed in the summer of 2005. The final two nines, solely designed by Greg Nash, are seamlessly incorporated into the original course thereby creating two 18-hole layouts (Hills and Orchard Courses) with traditional out-and-back configurations.The Hills and Orchard Courses\r\n\r\nThe golf course\'s generous corridors and expansive fairways unfold over the rolling hills and natural wetlands common to this neck of Placer County, California. Manicured fairways are framed by hazards and pockets of pine, oak and redwood trees that add to the golf course\'s aesthetic appeal as well as to the risk/reward challenges.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Orchard Course is best defined by its long and challenging par 4\'s, it\'s the short par-4 sixth hole that attracts the most birdies.\r\n\r\nThe Orchard Course\'s counterpart, The Hills Course, challenges golfers with an assortment of golf holes ranging from risk/reward par 5s to bombs-away par 4s, but it\'s arguably the par 3s that reflect the character of this 6,853-yard track. For example, the par-3 12th plays downhill with wetlands to the right and behind the green. The hole is as picturesque as it is challenging, and like many of the holes on the Hills course, close scrutiny to the day\'s pin sheet as well as sound course management are required to score.\r\n\r\nMemorable Tournaments\r\n\r\nThrough the years, The Lincoln Hills Golf Club has hosted competitive events (such as the LPGA Tour\'s Longs Drug Challenge in 2003) as well as hundreds of other local charity and corporate events.','916-434-7450','','','','','','','','1005 Sun City Lane\r\nLincoln, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 95648 ','Public','Billy Casper/Greg Nash','2005','Not Available','Not Available','Yes','Not Available','Not Available','','Yes','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area, Golf School.','',1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('7bbc8814-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','BLACKDUCK MUNICIPAL GOLF COURSE','This course very hilly course has a creek that comes into play on several holes.

There are many shots either uphill or downhill from elevated tees to elevated greens. The greens are medium to large in size with some undulating and many subtle breaks. There are trees and brush lining the fairways with some of it coming into play, particularly on the back nine. There are several sand bunkers on the course, many on which are very deep, particularly the ones around the greens. In the afternoon the wind can start blowing, adding to the difficulty of the course. There are seven holes where ponds and streams are part of the design. \'Golf Digest\' rated this course as the 61st best under the category of \'America\'s Top 75 Affordable Courses\' in 1996. In addition, \'Golf Digest\' rated this course 60th best under the 1998 category of \'Top 100 Courses You Can Play in the U.S.\' Fridays are included in the weekend green fee rates. The 5,763-yard ladies\' tees also have a men\'s course rating of 67.9 and a slope of 119. Kenneth H.

Although the fairways feature generous landing areas, the heavily undulated terrain provides for few even lies. The large greens are moderately contoured and play extremely true. One of the most challenging holes is No. 17, a 200-yard par 3. From the elevated tee, the hole plays to a green surrounded by marsh on three sides.

The terrain is basically flat, but there are a few elevated areas on a couple of holes. Well-positioned sand bunkers surround every green. The most difficult hole is #5, a 220-yard, par 3, requiring an uphill tee shot to a green with two bunkers guarding its front. If you want to play eighteen holes, the green fees for the second nine is slightly more on weekdays and an additional small charge on weekends. Juniors and seniors receive a discounts when playing either nine or eighteen holes. There is an additional ladies\' tee that can be used when playing an eighteen round.','760-876-5795','','','','','','','','S Main St\r\nLone Pine,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 93545 ','Public','Bob E.

Most of the fairways are tree lined, but they are still somewhat open. However, if you wish to score well, you\'ll need to make some lengthy shots. For example, hole #18, a 428-yard, par 4, typically plays directly into the wind. Because the course is located next to the Long Beach Airport, there aren\'t many obstacles to block the wind. Selecting the proper clubs on windy days is one of the more challenging aspects to playing this course. There are two beautiful lakes that come into play on three holes. The large greens are generally in fair condition and somewhat sloped. The carts at this course now have GPS readers/computers.

The first two holes can lull a first-time visitor into a relaxed state of mind because they measure only a few hundred yards in length with no real hazards involved. Then over the span of the next eight holes, golfers must face five par 4\'s measuring over 400 yards in length. Hole #6, a 456-yard, par 4, is by far the most difficult hole on the course. It forces the average golfer to play the hole more like a par 5, or least nail a fairway wood on the approach shot if they plan on putting for a birdie. The course\'s terrain is also a factor, including tree-lined fairways, elevated greens and many changes in elevation. The somewhat sloped greens vary between medium to large in size, are a little on the firm side, and are well bunkered with average speed. The Long Beach Open is held here every July. Special rates apply to residents of Long Beach. However, there is a twilight rate in the late afternoons for all golfers. Early morning walk-ons can place their names on the starter\'s list inside the coffee shop beginning at 5:30 AM.','562-494-5000','','','','','','','','5001 Dukemajian Dr\r\nLong Beach,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 90804-4311 ','Public','William F.

(Legend has it that Hugh Hefner, who lives off one of the fairways, was turned down for membership.) The 1928 William Bell design lies in the heart of Beverly Hills and shuns attention, but the quality of the course legendary.\r\n\r\nThe signature hole is the 11th, a par 3 reverse-Redan hole that features a downhill tee shot to a green that slopes hard from back to front. From the tee box, players are treated to a stunning view of the clubhouse and the city, which surrounds the course.\r\n\r\nThe fairways are rolling, the trees that line the holes are numerous and high, the bunkers are deep and uniquely shaped -- there are even deer that live within the walled grounds of the course.

The highlight of this course, however, are the expansive, lightning-fast greens which are surrounded by generous, puttable aprons, making Rustic Canyon a true \'putter\'s course.\' The course plays from 5,273 to 6,906 yards and there are four sets of tees to challenge all handicaps.\r\n\r\nThe course was ranked No. 2 on the list of 50 best courses under $50.\r\n\r\nRead more: http://www.golf.com/golf/courses_travel/coursefinder/course/0,28290,1530640,00.html#ixzz1URudCw4y\r\n','805-530-0221','','','','','','','','15100 Happy Camp Canyon Rd\r\nMoorpark, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 93021 ','Public','Hanse Golf Course Design','2002','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','$32 - $76','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','John Concialdi',1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('8216814f-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','QUAIL RANCH COUNTRY COURSE','This course\'s greens are difficult to read, and its terrain is hilly in certain areas, so you can expect some uneven lies.

The original course was the Lakes and Canyon nines, which were redesigned by Ted Robinson around 1990. An additional nine holes, the Oaks Course, was added in 1996 and designed by Garrett Gill. All three courses have some narrow fairways and approach shots will have to get past large eucalyptus and oak trees, as well as underbrush coming into play. The courses all require the accurate placement of shots in order to score well. Accuracy, on these courses, is far more important than distance. The greens on the Lakes and Canyon courses vary from small to large. The greens are sloped but the Lakes greens have very little undulation, while on the Canyon Course some of the greens are tiered. The Lakes Course has seven holes with water as part of the design. There is no water on the Canyon Course. All three courses have elevated tees and greens with both uphill and downhill shots required. On the Canyon Course almost every hole plays uphill or downhill, and sometimes both with some blind approach shots. The Oaks Course is the shortest of the three but accuracy is more important. Only a couple holes have water in play and there are only a few sand bunkers. There are several holes where you must cross brush areas from the tee to the fairways. The greens vary in size with several being very deep, adding as much as twenty yards to your approach shot, depending on where the hole is located. The club provides a special rate for nine holes when played before 8 AM. The club is owned and operated by American Golf.','805-343-1214','','','','','','','','1490 Golf Course Ln\r\nNipomo','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 93444-9358 ','Public','Ted Robinson','1965','Poa Annua Grass','Kikuya','Yes','41-50','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$32.00 - $42.00','N/A','Putting Green, Chipping Area, Teaching Pro','Rudi Fann',1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('832a5cec-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','IRONMAN GOLF COURSE','This par 3 course features Big Floyd Lake coming into play on three holes.

The architects were concerned more with speed of play rather than difficulty when designing Metropolitan Golf Links, therefore the course is generally flat and treeless. However, the wind can play a major factor in shot making. The undulated greens are large and a fair test of one\'s putting skills. The course is long though, playing from 5,099 to 6,959-yards, and offers five sets of tees to accommodate all skill levels.

You will have many uphill and downhill shots. Besides the hills, the major design feature of the course is the numerous large oak trees that were left in place and incorporated into the design. On several fairways trees were left in the middle of the fairways, which can block your approach shots to the green. Several holes use the trees to create narrow openings from the tee to the fairways. There are several large, deep sand bunkers both on the fairways and around the greens. The greens are medium to large in size and very fast. The greens have some slope and a few are tiered but they are not very undulating. The most difficult hole is #7, a 586-yard, par 5, which has a severe dogleg left fairway and plays uphill. This hole has a very narrow opening from the tee to the fairway and trees all along the fairway that can interfere with your shots. The back nine has several holes with water in play. Hole #15 is a 518-yard, par 5, featuring a dogleg right fairway that veers around a lake. This hole can be reached in two when hit to the left side of the fairway, leaving about a 200-yard shot to the green. Surrounding the course are several vineyards, and down the highway, wine tasting rooms. Kenneth H. Hunter, Jr., developed this course, along with La Purisima Golf Course in Lompoc and Sandpiper Golf Course in Goleta. All three courses have received recognition as outstanding courses.','805-237-7444','','','','','','','','4041 Hwy 46 E\r\nPaso Robles, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 93446-7301 ','Public','Kenneth Hunter & Mike McGinnis','1994','Bent Grass','Winter Rye','Yes','51-60','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$45.00 - $55.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Mike Bremer',1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('85086845-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','CEDAR HILLS GOLF COURSE','This executive course was built on hilly terrain, so if you hit an errant tee shot you may find yourself with an uneven lie.

Stands of Valley and Blue Oak trees decorate the layout, and vineyards and canyons can be seen in the distance. The course is very well bunkered, and the greens are straightforward. Water comes into play on five holes during the summer months and thirteen during the winter, when a dry creek fills and runs through the layout. The signature hole is #12, a 649-yard, par 5, requiring three long, precise shots over a dogleg left fairway, two creeks and past 400-year-old oaks to reach the well-bunkered green. The Legends West Course is a tribute to the classic courses and an elegant lifestyle of an era gone by. This course is surrounded on all sides by rolling hillsides and undulating vineyards. Carved by creeks and canyons, this tree-lined course is spectacular. Once there, you will be rewarded with a spectacular view up the valley to Mikes Peak, the highest point at Diablo Grande. \'Golf Digest\' selected this course 6th on its list of \'Best New Private Courses\' for 1998.

Like Augusta National, golfers know the course so intimately from television that it can seem less dramatic in person. After all, as an annual stop on the PGA Tour, this isn\'t a course that only steps into the major spotlight every decade or so. Telecasts often lavish attention on Pebble\'s closing holes, but the real magic is to be found on the front nine. The most spectacular series of holes you\'ll find anywhere are Nos. 5 through 8, which are on the promontory between Stillwater Cove and the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Pebble Beach is bland off the tee -- this is entirely a second-shot golf course. You can survive misses with your driver, but misfiring on your approach shots will make it a very long day. (It will be a long day regardless -- a round will take upwards of five hours.) You won\'t be writing about the opening few holes in your postcards home, but beware the deep cross bunker in the fairway on the second. Caddies call it the Yao Ming bunker after the 7-foot-6 Rockets center entered it and disappeared from view.\r\n\r\nFor most golfers, Pebble is all about the final two holes. Who doesn\'t want to try recreating Tom Watson\'s chip-in from the 1982 U.S. Open or Jack Nicklaus\' 1-iron that clattered against the flagstick a decade earlier? That\'s the charm of Pebble: a mixture of familiarity, history and superb golf. Is it worth the pricey greens fee? Sure. At least once.\r\n\r\n-- Eamon Lynch, from The Road to Pebble Beach\r\n\r\n--The director of the Pebble Beach Golf Academy is Laird Small, a GOLF Magazine Top 100 Teacher. In his article, My Fab 5, Small wrote that Pebble Beach is one of his favortite courses in the United States.

The first is a long par 5 that plummets down a hill and doglegs left, giving golfers a magnificent view of the Pacific. The second hole is a short, narrow, uphill par 4. The fairway is surrounded by ice plant, an indigenous weed that thrives in the sandy soil of the Monterey Peninsula. The 3rd hole, a mid-length par 3, again goes downhill toward the water to a green that is guarded by sandy mounds.\r\n\r\nThe 4th hole is one of Robert Trent Jones Sr.\'s favorite par 4s. Players must choose between playing it safe off the tee, which means attacking the pencil-thin green (in some areas it is less than six paces across) from farther out, or challenging the ice plant and sand on the left to set up a shorter approach. The 5th hole is a 197-yard par 3 that plays toward the ocean once again.\r\n\r\nCritics complain that, after the sixth tee, you\'re done with the ocean and the ice plant. That\'s true, but the inland holes are gorgeous and tough. Two are among the most underrated in golf: the reverse-cambered par-4 8th that slopes to the right but doglegs left, and the brutal 16th, a par 4 where merely hitting the green in regulation is cause for celebration. Recent improvements in drainage have Spyglass in its best shape ever.\r\n\r\nFor more information, go to pebblebeach.com.','831-625-8563','','','','','','','','Spyglass Hill Rd & Stevenson Dr\r\nPebble Beach,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 93953 ','Resort','Robert Trent Jones, Sr.','1966','Poa Annua Grass','Poa Annua Grass','Yes','71-80','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$350 - $385','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area, Golf School.','Bill Sendell',1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('85349fd4-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','CYPRESS POINT','Cypress Point is consistently ranked as one of the top courses in the U.S. and the World by Golf Magazine\'s panel of experts.\r\nCypress Point starts by spreading its Mackenzian fingers through the dunes as if to grab a firm hold on dry land, so it can dangle its lower extremities into the Pacific with confidence. Because of the intensely private nature of the club and the overwhelming famousness of its photogenic finish, the first 14 holes are virtually unknown to the golfing public, which is a shame, because they, too, are gorgeous. Eight and nine, two sometimes-drivable par fours, might be considered too short and quirky by today\'s standards, but only by those who don\'t have fun playing golf.\r\nWe played to the 14th green, all of us entranced by our surroundings, which included deer so secure it seemed as if they had been darted with Prozac. I was utterly spellbound by the sight of the 15th. I\'d seen so many photographs, but Ansel Adams couldn\'t have prepared me for a vision so blissful. Verily, I was gobsmacked.\r\nThe Pacific boiled on the rocks and tore at the kelp below, an otter lolled on his back in the shallows, a peregrine falcon hovered overhead, and the smell of the brine filled my nostrils. I sullied the moment by hitting a morbidly obese 7-iron, but it didn\'t matter. The 16th was even better.\r\nThis place is special, it must be, because it made me feel like playing golf again. Playing Cypress Point made me feel like a lucky, lucky man, and it is my favorite golf course. - David Feherty, Golf Magazine\r\n-- Cypress is also one of the most exclusive clubs in the world. Bob Hope once memorably summed up the club this way: \'One year they had a big membership drive at Cypress. They drove out 40 members.\' Hope was himself a member for more than 40 years, but he didn\'t recall playing more than a half-dozen times outside of the \'Crosby Clambake.\' He still paid, however.

Ross redesigned the course in 1919. The terrain is rolling, and lakes come into play on six holes. The fairways are wide, and the small greens are fast. There are numerous old trees on the course. This club is famous for being the site of the 1930 U.S. Open, the last major tournament during the year Bobby Jones won the Grand Slam.\r\n\r\nThe signature hole is #9, a 520-yard par 5, featuring a dogleg right fairway and a lake on the inside curve near the green. During the 1930 U.S. Open, Bobby Jones skipped his ball over the lake and made the famous birdie that would assure his Grand Slam.\r\n\r\nIn his article My Fab 5, GOLF Magazine Top 100 Teacher Laird Small wrote that Interlachen is one of his favorite courses in the United States. Here\'s what he wrote:\r\n\r\n\'I love the fact that all the par 5s on the course are reachable -- and for big hitters, an iron is all that\'s required on the second shot -- but you must put the ball in the ideal area on the greens because they are so undulating.\'','612-924-7424','','','','','','','','6200 Interlachen Blvd\r\nEdina','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ecf0dc60-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','','55436','Public','Willie Watson','1911','Bent Grass','Bent Grass','Yes','81-90','Sprinkler Heads Marked','$130.00 - $130.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Jock Olson',1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-03-03 17:43:51','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('85a2f052-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','TIPSINAH MOUNDS GOLF COURSE ','This club added a back nine during the 1998 season.

WOODSON GOLF CLUB','This picturesque course, situated in a quiet valley, was built on the natural terrain. The fast greens are well manicured, and the fairways are plush. An abundance of wildlife roams freely throughout the course, and every hole features views of the beautiful Ramona Mountains. The Amy Strong Castle, a National Historic Landmark built between 1916 and 1921, is located on the course property. This course and its personnel recently received an environmental award for the way in which they built a wooden trestle, golf cart bridge, which takes you to the third tee. The bridge crosses over a canyon sixty feet above a creek, resulting in a very scenic view. The terrain is hilly, so you should expect many uneven lies and changes in elevation. There are several extremely short par 4\'s in which you can drive the green with some help from the wind and the downhill design of the holes. Numerous large sand bunkers have been incorporated into this course\'s design. Due to the tall natural vegetation on the sides of the fairways, accuracy is at a premium. If you hit a shot into the natural vegetation areas, it is played as if hitting into a lateral water hazard. Senior discounts are only available during the summer from Monday through Thursday.

The wind can be a major factor here, especially during the late afternoons. Typically, hole #11, a 60-1yard, par 5, plays directly into the wind. The most scenic hole is #10, a 404-yard, par 4, because it features tall brownish grass, a dry river bed, and scenic views of the mountains in the background.

(He also bragged that \'nobody has better lawnmowers than us!\') Forgive him his enthusiasm. It took three years, $264 million and a million cubic yards of relocated earth to turn Pete Dye\'s punishing former Ocean Trails Golf Course into this fun and forgiving track. Redesigned by Trump and Tom Fazio, the 7,150-yard course is big and brash, just like the Donald. It sports wide fairways, bunkers lined with pulverized marble and Pacific views on every tee. The most memorable hole is the 238-yard par-3 17th, with a 45-foot waterfall that mists your cart as you motor to the green. It\'s equal parts golf hole and water ride, which is fitting because when your round is over, you\'ll want to get in line and go again.\r\n\r\nFor more information, go to trumpnationallosangeles.com.','(310) 265-5000','','','','','','','','One Ocean Trails Drive\r\nRancho Palos Verdes, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 90275 ','Public','Donald Trump and Tom Fazio','2006','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','$160 - $275','Yes','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','David Conforti',0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('869fa793-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','EVELETH MUNICIPAL GOLF COURSE','This course features narrow fairways and fast greens.

Tillinghast gem opened in 1915, well before many of Tillinghast\'s East Coast masterpieces.\r\n\r\nAt just over 6,600 yards in length, the course is not long by modern standards, but it rewards long and straight shots off the tee. Unlike many Bay Area courses that use trees and shrubs to shape and contour the fairways, Tillinghast allowed the rolls and hills of the land dictate how the course twists turns. Scores of fairway bunkers demand golfers carefully consider the wisest strategy before hitting their shot.\r\n\r\nWhile the club is intensely private and shuns virtually attention, the marquee hole at San Francisco Golf Club is the 184-yard, par-3 7th which is known as the \'Duel Hole.\' The canyon where the hole now lays was the site of the last duel in the United States. Playing down a steep hill, the kidney-shaped green has a hump in its center. Shots that land on the back of the hump can easily bound into one of the bunkers behind the green, so players are often forced to putt over the ridge.\r\n\r\nThe club was originally founded in 1895 and has been listed by the USGA as one of the first 100 clubs established in the U.S.','415-469-4122','','','','','','','','Junipero Serra Blvd & Brotherhood\r\nSan Francisco, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 94132 ','Private','A.

Expect firm fairways, reasonable rough and subtle but slick greens. The course peaks with a stretch of first-rate par 4s on Lake Merced.\r\n\r\nGolf Magazine\'s Course Spy visited Harding Park and had this to say about the site of the 2009 Presidents Cup:\r\n\r\nService -- A friendly starter helped offset the gruff greeting we received at check-in. Kudos, too, for the beverage cart experience: the frequency and personality were both surprisingly solid for such a busy track.\r\n\r\nPace of Play -- We got lucky: six weeks before the Presidents Cup came to Harding, tee times had been reduced, allowing us to buzz around. Still, even with rangers on patrol, the cheap green fees for locals mean constant crowds on most days.\r\n\r\nQuality -- The poor man\'s Olympic Club is undeniably great looking, sitting on a bluff surrounded on three sides by Lake Merced. And it\'s a strong test. However, soft conditions and too many holes that look and play alike are drawbacks.\r\n\r\nValue -- For residents of the City by the Bay, Harding Park is a great deal at less than $60. For outsiders who have to pay full boat, it\'s hardly a stickup, but for the mushy fairways and minimal services, it\'s priced too high for everyday play.\r\n\r\nVerdict -- Since we know we\'re never going to get an invite to play the Olympic Club next door, Harding is definitely the next best thing. Great scenery, an easy walk, and service that is improving make the price tag easier to swallow.\r\n\r\nThis Club has multiple courses:\r\n\r\n    Harding\r\n    Fleming','415-664-4690','','','','','','','','99 Harding Rd\r\nSan Francisco, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 94132-1021 ','Public','Willie Watson','1925','Bent Grass','Bent Grass','No','21-30','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$105 - $155','N/A','Putting Green','Mark Fallon',1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('8aeb8257-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','Two River Golf Course','This scenic course is located in the country.

It is a terrific Robert Trent Jones II layout in a retreat favored by dotcom millionaires, but you\'ll probably need to cash in a few stock options to cover your tee time.\r\nCordeValle opened in 1999 in San Martin, 30 minutes south of San Jose, near the heart of Silicon Valley. For your four Franklins -- plus a required stay at the small but superb Rosewood resort -- you get a boldly bunkered, back-to-nature layout routed through a tranquil valley and draped across rocky hillsides. Creeks and wetlands play a role, notably at the bucolic, if brutal, 573-yard par-5 third, but the design is mostly free of distracting bells and whistles.\r\n\'We tried to make this course appear as if it had been here a long time,\' says Bruce Charlton, Jones\'s chief design officer. Mandatory caddies and foursomes on foot further enhance the experience. An added highlight is the nearby Clos LaChance Winery, assuming that just playing here doesn\'t burst your financial bubble.\r\nFor more information, go to cordevalle.com.','408-695-4500','','','','','','','','1 CordeValle Club Drive\r\nSan Martin,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 95046-9433 ','Public','Robert Trent Jones, Jr.','1999','Bent Grass','Winter Rye','Yes','61-70','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$360 - $390','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Joe Root',1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('8c0a8049-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','POPLAR CREEK GOLF COURSE','This championship, par 70 course was originally constructed in 1933 as San Mateo Municipal.

For this reason, it is often referred to as \'The Poor Man\'s Pebble.\'\r\nOpened in 1929, Bobby Jones scratched out a 1-over 75 to christen the course. While par has been chopped to 70 today, it seldom takes a beating. Ben Hogan, Byron Nelson and Tiger Woods have all failed to better 67 here.\r\nPasatiempo sports stellar par-4s. Byron Nelson said the 384-yard 11th is one of the toughest he ever faced. MacKenzie\'s advice: \'Do not hook on the par-4 11th. We have allowed for a straight drive and a crisp iron across the arroyo to the green.\' MacKenzie also said that the 395-yard 16th hole was the best two-shotter he ever designed.\r\nArchitect Tom Doak recently re-worked portions of the course to their former glory. You\'ll so enjoy the challenges at Pasatiempo that you won\'t even notice that it ends on a par 3.\r\nFrom Sports Illustrated Writer-Reporter Rick Lipsey: Marion Hollins, the creator of Pasatiempo, is probably the most famous woman in golf you\'ve never heard of. Hollins, who died in 1944 at age 52, was a flamboyant trailblazer on and off the course. Outside of golf, she was a female activist and a shrewd and successful entrepreneur. The daughter of a partner at J.P. Morgan, Hollins invested in one California oil strike that netted her $2.5 million. Hollins was also an expert horse rider and the only woman in America who had a men\'s handicap in polo. But Hollins made perhaps her biggest mark in golf. She was a top player, winning the 1921 U.S. Amateur, and she created several golf clubs from scratch, including the Women\'s National Golf Club on Long Island, a women-only club, Cypress Point on Californi','831-459-9155','','','','','','','','20 Clubhouse Rd\r\nSanta Cruz,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 95060-1802 ','Public','Alister Mackenzie','1929','Bent Grass','Winter Rye','No','41-50','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.','$220 - $250','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Ken Woods',1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('8cdeebc1-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','OAK RIDGE COUNTRY CLUB','This course was built on hilly terrain, so you can expect many changes in elevation and uneven lies.

The fairways are wide with brush along the sides. There are not too many sand bunkers but the ones that are there are large and some have grass mounds in the middle of them. Several holes have barranca and creeks that cross the fairways, particularly on the back nine. The back nine has many very interesting holes, including the signature hole, #13. This hole, nicknamed \'Snags\' because of the two tall dead trees that are in the fairway, is a 501-yard, par 5, which requires a tee shot from out of a grove of trees to a downhill, dogleg fairway that provides a scenic view of the Pacific Ocean. The second shot must carry a creek located only 200 yards from the tee box. An accurate approach shot is required to a green with a narrow opening and protected by sand bunkers on three sides. When you play the course ask the pro shop for their sheets describing each hole and how to play them. You can reach the pro shop directly by calling (707) 785-2468.','800-732-7262','','','','','','','','49300 Hwy 1\r\nSea Ranch, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 95497 ','Public','Robert Muir Graves','1975','Bent Grass','Bent Grass','Yes','51-60','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.','$45.00 - $65.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area, Golf School.','Tom Nelson',1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('8e8748f0-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','LEISURE WORLD 3 PAR GOLF COURSE','This par 3 course is very easy to play because it only has a few water hazards.

But golfers can reap a nice harvest with a new Arthur Hills/Steve Forrest design in the heart of SoCal\'s wine country. Journey at Pechanga is located 60 miles north of San Diego and is the newest amenity at the upscale Pechanga Resort & Casino, a venture of the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians.\r\nEach hole features a Luiseno name, and the course is sprinkled with cultural exhibits that relate the story of the tribe. \'I\'ve never worked on a site quite like this one,\' says Forrest. \'Journey sets out at the base of a large mountain, crosses the Pechanga River, a dry wash where I have not yet seen any water, then basically sets off into the sky.\'\r\nThe soaring elevation changes mandate using a cart, but the payoff comes on the 488-yard, par-4 6th, which plunges 175 feet from tee to fairway, then another 100 feet down to the green. \'The hang time there is stupendous, between 8 and 10 seconds,\' says Forrest. \'If you hit it just right, you can almost drive the green thanks to the speed slot we created on one side of the landing zone.\' Driving a 488-yard hole? Now that\'s one Journey that\'s worth the trip.\r\nJourney at Pechanga was named one of the Best New Courses of 2008.','888-732-4264','','','','','','','','45000 Pechanga Parkway\r\nTemecula, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 92592 ','Public','Arthur Hills/Steve Forrest','0','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','$150 - $200','N/A','None','',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('946190e4-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','COUNTRYSIDE GOLF CLUB','The fairways are lined with trees, and the greens are large.

It was ranked 7th in difficulty by \'California Golf Magazine.\' Water hazards (including four lakes and a couple of creeks) come into play on at least five separate occasions, plus many sand and grass bunkers are spread throughout the course\'s design. The terrain is somewhat hilly, so expect many uneven lies. The fairways are either lined by trees, natural vegetation, or out-of-bounds stakes, putting shot accuracy at a premium. The signature hole is #8, a 165-yard, par 3, requiring a tee shot from off an elevated tee (about forty feet high) to an island green. The other three par 3\'s on the course are equally challenging. Hole #12, a 165-yard, par 3, requires a tee shot from off an elevated tee to a green that is protected by a forty-foot wide sand bunker in front, plus additional bunkers on both the left and right sides. All the undulating greens vary from average to large in size, and some feature two and three tiers. Hole #18 will prove to be a challenging way to conclude your round. This hole, a par 5, is 555 yards in length and requires an assortment of shots in order to make par. Wind can be a factor during the late afternoon. The club requests that you only hit irons or short woods off the driving range.

A sister course to the Jack Nicklaus-designed Old Greenwood, Gray\'s Crossing is a three-year-old Peter Jacobsen/Jim Hardy creation 40 minutes west of Reno. At 6,500 feet, it offers plenty of opportunities to smack oversized drives amid panoramic vistas, but be warned: stray shots will perish in the towering pines and wetlands that frame the fairways. The tumbling terrain includes two driveable par-4s: the 6th, which plummets almost 100 feet to the green, and the 14th, which plays uphill. Just how reachable is the sixth? During the course opening in 2007, not only did both Jacobsen and Hardy drive the green, but so did guest Annika Sorenstam and Matt Grieser. Matt who? He\'s \'Sign Boy\' from the FootJoy commercials.

Some of Nicklaus\'s strongest tests are utter beat-downs, but Old Greenwood is pure pleasure.','530-550-7010','','','','','','','','12915 Fairway Drive\r\nTruckee,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec5e0f3f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' ','Public','Jack Nicklaus','2004','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$185 - $185','Yes','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area, Golf School.','',0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('96b1a30b-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','PINES AT GRAND VIEW LODGE, THE','This resort features three nine-hole courses that are played combinations, as well as two 18-hole championship courses and a separate nine-hole course.\r\n\r\nThe Deacon\'s Lodge course opened in 1999 and was hailed by many critics as being Arnold Palmer\'s finest design. The course is set amongst three wilderness lakes, as well as wetlands and a beautiful forest. With numerous waste bunkers, it is a visually intimidating layout.\r\n\r\nThe Preserve course opened in 1996 and features rolling hills and several elevated tees set amongst wetlands and woodlands.\r\n\r\nFrom the windows in the clubhouse, there is a great view of the waterfall on the Woods Course. The 16th hole, a 400-yard, par 4 is one of the most-picturesque, requiring a downhill shot to an elevated green.\r\n\r\nThe resort\'s signature hole is seventh on the Lakes Course, a 152-yard, par 3, which requires a tee shot over water to a green framed in the rear by large timbers. The fifth hole on the Lakes Course, a 356-yard, par 4 requires a blind shot over water to the green.\r\n\r\nThis Club has multiple courses:\r\n\r\n    Woods/Marsh\r\n    Marsh/Lakes\r\n    Preserve\r\n    The Garden\r\n    Deacon\'s Lodge\r\n    Lakes/Woods.','218-963-0001','','','','','','','','23521 Nokomis\r\nNisswa,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ecf0dc60-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 56468 ','Resort','Joel Goldstrand','1990','Bent Grass','Bent Grass','Yes','41-50','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$79.50 - $89.50','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area, Golf School.','Eric Peterson',1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('96b8cb80-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','LAHONTAN GOLF CLUB','This course\'s design incorporates the magnificent beauty of the area and its natural terrain, including mature trees, constant elevation changes, and streams and ponds offering Mother Nature\'s scenic gift and Tom Weiskopf\'s imaginative golf challenge.

The fairways are wide and generous, and the greens are relatively small, rewarding accurately placed approach shots. Every hole has been integrated with the natural terrain, which gives each a distinct personality and challenge. Water comes into play on five holes, and most holes offer risk/reward opportunities. A particularly challenging hole is #2, nicknamed \'Gooseneck.\' It sits in a picturesque valley flanked on the right by wetlands and a massive 30-yard fairway bunker.

The signature hole is #4, a 340-yard, par 4, requiring a 230-yard carry (from the back tee) over marshlands to a medium-sized green with a picturesque, over-hanging tree. Another outstanding hole is #6, a 460-yard, par 4, featuring a split fairway. The pro shop has an illustration you can purchase of hole #8, a 540-yard, par 5, which has an elevated tee and a view of the marshlands beyond the green. \'GOLF Magazine\' also selected this course 68th in the 1998 category of the \'Top Courses You Can Play In The U.S.\' This course has one of the largest driving ranges in the state with over twenty-seven stations. Teaching facilities are also available for private or group lessons. A new clubhouse was completed in 1997. Soft-spiked shoes are mandatory; if you don\'t have soft spikes, the club personnel will change them for you as part of the green fee.','952-445-3500','','','','','','','','3151 Wilds Ridge\r\nPrior Lake','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ecf0dc60-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 55372-3247 ','Public','Tom Weiskopf & Jay Morrish','1995','Bent Grass','Bent Grass','Yes','61-70','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.','$99.00 - $99.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area, Golf School.','Shad Gordon',1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('9c254d57-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','SOUTH HILLS COUNTRY CLUB','This narrow course has tree-lined fairways and well-bunkered greens.

Like Lewis and Clark, who passed 100 miles south of here, golfers have the place to themselves, save for the occasional elk or moose. Circling Raven\'s par 3s average almost 220 yards. The 13th is 253 yards across a gully, with wetlands right and pines lurking in back. The 386-yard 8th is short but doesn\'t lack a \'wow\' factor, playing downhill to a green framed by birches, poplars and pines. The Coeur d\'Alene resort and its floating green are a half-hour -- and $100 -- north of Circling Raven.\r\n\r\nExcerpt from the article \'Top Ten You Can Play,\' Golf Magazine, February 2004\r\n\r\nFor more information, go to cdacasino.com.','800-523-2464','','','','','','','','37914 S US Hwy 95\r\nWorley,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','eca177fb-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 83876 ','Resort','Gene Bates','2003','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$65 - $95','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','',1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('a529d25f-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','COFFEE MILL GOLF & COUNTRY CLUB ','This course has several breathtaking views of the Mississippi River.

The Desert Hawk and Coyote Run courses opened in January, 2003, followed by the Eldorado Valley in summer 2003. Designed by architect Mark Rathert the three nines play through three distinct desert style layouts or \'themes\'. All three courses are generally wide open, and there are no blind tee shots or hidden hazards. The Desert Hawk nine plays through natural rolling terrain and boasts a combination of oasis and desert themes. To this end, water features prominently on the opening and closing holes, and there are plenty of strategically placed bunkers to challenge play. The fairways are expansive and the large greens are challenging but fair. The Desert Hawk nine plays from 2,429 to 3,843-yards. The Coyote Run 9 offers more of a challenge than Desert Hawk. This course was designed around a number of arroyos, which coupled with subtle elevation changes, make for challenging play, and opportunites for some strategic shot making. Coyote Run plays from 2,555 to 3,785-yards. The third nine, Eldorado Valley has expansicve fairways that will reward heavy hitters. However, multiple, deep fairways bunkers demand accurate shots off the tees. All three courses feature six sets of tees to accommodate a variety of handiaps and skill levels.

You might find yourself saying exactly the same about the PGA Golf Club Coyote Springs, which sits alone in the starkly beautiful desert roughly 50 miles north of Las Vegas, Nevada.\r\n\r\nIt\'s part of PGA Village, a development that is intended to be a western version of the original Port St. Lucie spread. There are plans for up to 15 golf courses and some 159,000 homes, but for now the only draw is a terrific Jack Nicklaus track that opened in April. Wind is a constant factor in this part of the country, so Nicklaus provided ample landing areas, but he also peppered the firm fairways with dozens of well-placed, tattered-edge bunkers that help to keep the big hitters honest. Lakes and waterfalls are in play on a dozen holes, but your key to scoring at Coyote Springs will be your putter. The internal green contouring is some of the most intricate of Jack\'s career.\r\n\r\nCoyote Springs was named one of the Best New Courses of 2008\r\n\r\nRead Gary Van Sickle\'s feature on Coyote Springs','877-742-8455','','','','','','','','3100 State Route 168\r\nCoyote Springs,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed121df0-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 89037 ','Public','Jack Nicklaus','2008','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','$120 - $200','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','',0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('a5b337ae-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','DAYTON VALLEY COUNTRY CLUB','This course, which is located forty minutes from Lake Tahoe, has forty acres of water hazards incorporated into its design, affecting play on twelve holes.

These two championship courses sit next to each other just a few miles over the hill from Lake Tahoe in historic Genoa, Nevada. The courses, the Lakes Course and the Resort Course (formally called the Sierra Nevada Golf Resort), recently became one single club: Genoa Lakes Golf Club and Resort. They both occupy an idyllic slice of high desert in the shadows of the towering Sierra Nevada Mountains that separate the states of California and Nevada. But each course has its own identity. The Lakes Course, an annual U.S. Open qualifying site, with its sun-sparkled lakes, wetlands, indigenous trees and magnificent views of the Sierras was opened in 1993. The Resort Course, opened in 1997, offers fairways surrounded by sagebrush and native vegetation. It\'s devoid of trees, with 300 feet of elevation changes and 132 bunkers--a course that has few water features.

Reflection Bay is a course to be managed, not conquered.\r\n\r\nFairways here are generous and the bunkering stern, but much of the course\'s bite comes around the greens. At the 528-yard fifth hole, a stream along the right encourages golfers to aim left, where par-killing bunkers await. The green is defended on the left by mini moguls; find them and you\'ll face a pitch to a green that is about as slick as the stepping stones you must navigate to cross the stream and reach the putting surface.\r\n\r\nFive holes at Reflection Bay play along the lake. The seventh, a 452-yard par 4, calls for a carry of nearly 250 yards over a gulch that cuts the fairway as decisively as a seasoned blackjack dealer. Clear the hazard and it\'s a short approach to a waterfront green that gathers around a deep bunker. Place your bets.\r\n\r\nThe postcard hole is the 199-yard eighth, a peninsula par 3 with breathing room to the right and watery doom to the left. But the most enjoyable hole may be the 393-yard 10th, which on the scorecard looks like the blues and greens got switched. Yes, that small green strip is the fairway, smothered by water. Watching your approach sail over all that aqua is like watching your paycheck ride a roulette wheel -- it\'s all or nothing.\r\n\r\nIf you need another reason to find your swing, your gallery at the 164-yard 17th, where the green juts dauntingly into the lake, might include Diva Las Vegas herself, Celine Dion, ','702-740-4653','','','','','','','','75 MonteLago Blvd\r\nHenderson,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed121df0-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 89011 ','Resort','Jack Nicklaus','1998','Bent Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','81-90','Sprinkler Heads Marked','$275.00 - $295.00','Yes','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area, Golf School.','Jon Spatz',1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('a6e05a4e-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','SOUTHSHORE GOLF CLUB','This course features numerous changes in elevation, which affords spectacular views of the 320-acre Lake Las Vegas.

There are a couple of fairways that necessitate careful play over ample sand bunkers. Concord is the newer of Revere\'s two courses. Also a desert style course, the Concord plays from 5,306 to 7,034-yards. With wide open, undulating fairways, the Concord can offer some challenging lies.

It is one of the most unique golfing experiences in the country. This Links style course faithfully recreates holes inspired by the British Open rotation golf courses such as \'The Road Hole\' and \'Hell Bunker\' from the old course at St. Andrews and \'The Postage Stamp\' from Royal Troon. Other legendary golf courses in the loop include Carnoustie, Turnberry, Royal Liverpool, Prestwick, Royal Lytham, Muirfield and Royal Birkdale. Forecaddies and Walking Caddies are available and recommended to truly enhance the Scottish experience. They are familiar with the course and help with club selection, yardage to the green and other traditional services, but they are also extremely knowledgeable about the history of each hole. Monuments were erected at various points throughout the course indicating spots where great moments in British Open history took place. A Champions Wall is erected near the practice green honoring American champions of the British Open. This isn\'t your typical round of golf, and whether you are into the history of the game or just want a shot at Tiger Woods course record of 67 (Feb., 2001), Royal Links will provide you with some very memorable golfing and is an experience that can only be found in Las Vegas.

The club, nestled 3,000 feet above sea level against the breathtaking Spring Mountains and Red Rock Canyon, overlooks the fabulous Las Vegas Strip.\r\n\r\nThe Palm Course\'s most challenging hole is #12, a 220-yard, par 3, featuring sand bunkers guarding the front of its green. The Mountain Course is very hilly and open. The greens are sloped and fast, and there are many trees that come into play throughout the course.\r\n\r\nIt has been built to reflect some of the famous holes seen from various courses throughout the world. Hole #1, \'Double Green,\' represents the famous double greens at St. Andrews in Scotland. Hole #10, named \'Island Green,\' requires a 100-yard tee shot over water to an island green. This hole pays homage to the innovative Pete Dye who is credited with the island green design. This is the only course that you are allowed to walk.\r\n\r\nFrom the scenery, to the staff, to Arnold Palmer\'s uncompromising Championship courses, Angel Park has earned it\'s reputation throughout the southwest as one of the finest full-service golf facilities. The eighteen hole, night-lit putting course is filled with sand bunkers and water hazards, making it a challenge for even the best putters. The Cloud 9 Course is also night lit. Other practice facilities include a night lit, double-sided practice range and practice greens.\r\n\r\nFor more information visit the Las Vegas Ultimate Golf Trip Guide.\r\n\r\nThis Club has multiple courses:\r\n\r\n    Mountain\r\n    Cloud 9\r\n    Palm','702-254-4653','','','','','','','','100 S Rampart Blvd\r\nLas Vegas','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed121df0-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 89145-5718 ','Public','Arnold Palmer & Ed Seay','1989','Bermuda Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','11--20','Sprinkler Heads Marked','$125.00 - $145.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro','Don Cramer',1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('a827c4a8-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','WINONA COUNTRY CLUB','This course\'s original nine holes were designed by the Scottish professional Ben Knight, and the second nine holes were added in the sixties based on drawings made by Robert Trent Jones. This course is quite scenic because it was built on the natural rolling terrain and amongst the surrounding woods. A creek meanders through the course that comes into play on five of the first nine holes. The greens are somewhat slow. The main difficulties are the narrow fairways and the large sand bunkers.

The courses were all designed by Johnny Miller with consultation from Chi Chi Rodriguez.\r\n\r\nThis original Desperado/Diablo Course is a desert-style layout that puts a premium on placement shots. Only ninety-five acres on this course are planted with grass. The main focus of the design centers on the natural scenery of the desert. The fairways afford generous landing areas, if you choose the right club.\r\n\r\nGenerally the greens are medium-sized, but some of them are small. A lake comes into play on only one hole. All eighteen holes have their own unique characteristics. The local pro states that every hole is a signature hole. There are many grass and sand bunkers incorporated into the course\'s design, but very few trees.\r\n\r\nThe green fees shown also include unlimited range balls for the day. Weekday green fees listed are for Monday through Thursday; weekend rates are Friday through Sunday.\r\n\r\nFor more information visit the Las Vegas Ultimate Golf Trip Guide.\r\n\r\nThis Club has multiple courses:\r\n\r\n    Desperado/Diablo\r\n    Diablo/Outlaw\r\n    Desperado/Outlaw','702-243-8160','','','','','','','','9119 Alta Dr\r\nLas Vegas','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed121df0-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 89128-8501 ','Resort','Johnny Miller','1995','Bermuda Grass','Winter Rye','Yes','21-30','Electronic Range System','$90.00 - $120.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Charles Packard',1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('a83f60ba-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','WINTHROP GOLF CLUB','This is an easy course if you hit the ball straight and long.

Morrish has crafted some of the southwest\'s most talked about desert courses, of which Painted Desert was the first. Painted Desert has been host to The Nevada Open and several amateur events.

The layout is located on the very scenic Paiute Reservation. The fairways are wide, and the greens are small, flat and fast. Ponds come into play on seven holes. The Tav-ai-Kaiv Sun Mountain Course opened in August, 1996. The greens are undulating and softer than the Nu-Waiv Kaiv greens. The latest addition to the Las Vegas Paiute Golf Resort is the Wolf Creek Course. Open October 2001, it plays to 7,400-yards and was designed by Pete Dye. This links-style course is noted for the severe mounding throughout, and features some dramatic elevation changes as well. Water comes into play on several holes in the form of two lakes.\r\n\r\nGOLF Magazine Course Spy says of the Wolf Creek Course:\r\n\r\nService -- \'Good morning, sir.\' \'May I take your bag, sir?\' The attention starts when you pull up and continues on the course, where starters treat you to Homeric recitations on local rules and cart girls are a whistle-call away.\r\n\r\nPace of play -- Get out early, when most of Vegas is sleeping off its losses, and you\'ll breeze around. But wait until late morning, and you\'ll find yourself backlogged behind beefy beer-swillers and slow-playing conventioneers.\r\n\r\nQuality -- The youngest and finest of Paiute\'s three layouts, this Pete Dye design works its way into your memory with delightful doglegs, cleverly contoured greens and an island-green par 3 that often plays into a swirling wind.\r\n\r\nValue -- Given the course\'s quality, the Wolf ranks as a relative bargain in Vegas. Your best bet? Show up with a local to pay the resident rate ($89 weekdays; $99 weekends), which might be the finest golf deal in town.\r\n\r\nVerdict -- Yeah, it\'s pricey. But the place is cool, the course conditions are pure, and the clubhouse is a sweet place for a post-round drink. Remember: This is Vegas, baby. No one comes here to save money.\r\n\r\nFor more information visit the Las Vegas Ultimate Golf Trip Guide.\r\n\r\nThis Club has multiple cou','800-711-2833','','','','','','','','10325 Nu-Wav Kaiv Blvd\r\nLas Vegas','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed121df0-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 89124-8411','Resort','Pete Dye','1995','Bent Grass','Winter Rye','Yes','91-100','250, 200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$125.00 - $165.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Byron Cone',1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('a91bd399-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','DESERT ROSE GOLF COURSE','This course is friendly to all skill levels.

There are two reasons for this: For years it was open only to high rollers at Steve Wynn\'s Mirage casino, and even now -- when the course is open to guests at all MGM Mirage properties -- the fee is a high-rollin\' $500. But despite its infamous $40 million price tag -- in 1989 dollars -- Shadow Creek is no typically gaudy totem of Synthetic City.\r\n\r\nTrue, the course offers not a hint of the surrounding desert. (The only sand you\'ll see is in the bunkers.) Instead, Tom Fazio\'s design conjures a Carolinas feel with treelined corridors and more rises and falls than a novice\'s chip stack. But what you get for your five notes is one fine hole built upon another until you reach a show-stopping finale at Nos. 17 and 18.\r\n\r\nThe strong holes actually begin at the fourth, an eye-catching par 5 that curls around a lake, followed by a 206-yard par 3 at which your tee shot is played across the roof of a mini-forest. One interesting quirk here: The course has no UGSA handicap or slope rating because it\'s designed to be a match-play track. This is Vegas, after all, home of the $1 million Nassau.\r\n\r\nIt\'s easy to dismiss Shadow Creek as a mere feat of engineering, a symbol of what you can do with flat desert if you have an unlimited bankroll. It\'s surely that, but much more as well. Perhaps the best tribute to Shadow Creek is that the finest course in Las Vegas -- one designed as a playground for the town\'s biggest bettors and still the pinnacle of glitter-speckled golf -- makes you forget where you are. It\'s simply great golf. Nothing more, and certainly nothing less. -- Eamon Lynch\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit the Las Vegas Ultimate Golf Trip Guide and shadowcreek.com.','702-399-7111','','','','','','','','3 Shadow Creek Drive\r\nNorth Las Vegas','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed121df0-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 89031-2402 ','Resort','Tom Fazio & Andy Banfield','1989','Bent Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','61-70','No Yardage Markers','$500 - $500','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Monte Montgomery',1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('a9e2d82a-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','WILLOW CREEK GOLF COURSE','This course is a desert-style layout that has a plethora of strategically-placed willow and cottonwood trees. The trees are strategically placed around the greens, as well as down the sides of the fairways, some of which are dogleg configurations. Some of the greens are completely hidden because of the placement of such trees. The greens are well-conditioned, as are the fairways. If the golfer is careful to hit the greens, he or she will remain trouble-free. The greens are fast and small in size. The signature hole is #17, a 569-yard, par 5, which features a dogleg left fairway and a large pond in the middle of the fairway around the dogleg bend. From the lake it is all uphill to the green. Water comes into play on eleven holes in all. Holes #12 and #13 are split by a creek that runs across both fairways.

The Lakes is a links-style course designed by Robert Trent Jones, Jr., that has integrated the natural environment in its design, including numerous natural lakes, centuries-old cottonwood trees and awe-inspiring views of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. The design features water coming into play on eleven out of its eighteen holes, and generous sand and grass bunkers have been incorporated into the design as well. The Hills Course is mountain-style design by Hale Irwin, and incorporates the elevation changes of Nevada\'s Great Basin. However, the course retains a \'linksy\' feel, with small, fast greens and deep bunkers. Group packages for seventeen to thirty-six people are available by setting a reservation at least six months in advance, and for more than thirty-seven players, eighteen months in advance.','775-626-6000','','','','','','','','6600 N.

It proved a stirring site for the 1985 U.S. Senior Open, when Miller Barber mastered the 6,200-foot elevation to win his third title. Over the past decade Tom Fazio has enhanced the playability, but most folks know the course best as the venue of an annual celebrity event. Despite all of the remarkable displays from hockey legends and Emmy winners, no single swing has been broadcast with greater frequency than Mr. Barkley\'s double-hitch, stutter-step smother hook that features a trajectory never before witnessed in golf. That swing encapsulates everything great about Tahoe and the entire Northern California road trip: Seen once, it\'s an unforgettable experience.','775-588-3566','','','','','','','','180 Lake Pkwy\r\nStateline','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed121df0-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 89449','Public','George Fazio','1968','Bent Grass','Bent Grass','Yes','51-60','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$140 - $240','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Randy Fox',1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('ab140613-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','TOANA VISTA GOLF COURSE ','This course was built on desert terrain and features very fast greens.

The most challenging combination is the White/Gold Course, and the best hole is probably #9 on the White Course, a 471-yard, par 4. On this hole, players must hit their tee shot over a slight rise in the fairway if they hope to reach the green in two. The approach must travel a good 200 yards over water to a three-tiered putting surface.\r\n\r\nThis Club has multiple courses:\r\n\r\n    White/Gold\r\n    Blue/Gold\r\n    Blue/White','480-917-6660','','','','','','','','3751 S Clubhouse Dr\r\nChandler','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec55e77f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 85248-4200 ','Public','Ted Robinson','1985','Bermuda Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','31-40','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.','$115.00 - $115.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','John Hendricks',1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('ad288d25-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','IRONWOOD COUNTRY CLUB','This mature short championship course is an ideal couples course set in a country club environment.

The Meadow Course opened in 1999 and is a great counterpart for the Canyon Course. The Meadow Course has smaller greens than the original design, but has more water hazards and is considered to be a little bit more forgiving off the tee. The Arizona Republic wrote that the Meadow Course is perhaps the best layout in Northern Arizona. One major difference between the courses is that holes #5 through #8 on the Meadow Course are situated in a meadow and offer a more open playing area and more scenic potential than the Canyon Course. The beautiful Canyon Course has ponds and creeks coming into play on many of its holes. The signature hole is #9, a 466-yard, par 4, requiring shots alongside and over a pond, then an approach shot over a creek to the green. All of the fairways are tree lined. This course was rated the best in Arizona by \'Golf Digest\' for the years 1995-98. The same publication chose it 44th out of \'America\'s 100 Greatest Courses\' for 1995 and 1996, and 48th in 1997-98. \'GOLF Magazine\' also rated the course 62nd in its category of \'Top 100 Courses in the U.S.\' for 1995, 67th for 1997 and 79th for 1999. \'GOLFWEEK\' selected it 22nd on its list of \'America\'s 100 Best Modern Courses\' for 1998 and 16th for 1999.\r\n\r\nThis Club has multiple courses:\r\n\r\n    Canyon\r\n    Meadow','520-525-9014','','','','','','','','657 Forest Highlands Dr\r\nFlagstaff, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec55e77f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 86001-8434 ','Private','Tom Weiskopf & Jay Morrish','1988','Bent Grass','Bluegrass','Yes','61-70','00, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.','$70.00 - $86.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Denise Martinez',1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('ae327ea2-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','BROOKLYN-VICTOR COUNTRY CLUB','This hilly course features many sand bunkers guarding its fairways and greens.

Since opening in 2001, this facility has catapulted to \'must play\' status thanks to its incomparable scenery and holes that zigzag artfully through canyons, over ridges and down mountain slopes. Free of water restrictions, We-Ko-Pa features wide fairways and large greens for more authentic reminders of the desert. There are no homes or roads along the courses, and you won\'t find any out of bounds stakes out there either.\r\n\r\nOn the 7,225-yard Scott Miller-designed Cholla Course you will find a 50-foot-high boulder rising like a tombstone in the fairway of the 606-yard 10th, while a small wall fronting the green at the 587-yard 8th neatly mirrors the shape of the Red Mountains in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe Saguaro Course, deigned by Ben Crenshaw and Bill Coore, opened December 2006. It features more breathtaking views and is designed to be walkable, a rarity in the desert.\r\n\r\n\'This piece of land has some very interesting natural movement to it,\' said Crenshaw of the new We-Ko-Pa course. \'I think this golf course will be pretty unique for the desert.

The greens on the course are undulating, protected by bunkers and medium in size. The fairways are very undulating and open. Large boilers on the backside of the green highlight #13, the course\'s signature hole. This 581-yard, par 5, is incredibly scenic.','520-472-6840','','','','','','','','402 S Clubhouse Rd\r\nPayson,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec55e77f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 85541 ','Private','Tom Weiskopf & Jay Morrish','1999','Bent Grass','Winter Rye','Yes','11--20','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.','$85.00 - $85.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Thomas P.

With three large bunkers running along the right side of the lay-up area, even playing it safe has its risks.\r\n\r\nThe 212-yard, par-3 9th hole goes back down the hill and requires players to hit over a small pond to reach the green.\r\n\r\nThe 374-yard, par-4 15th hole is one of Rees Jones\' favorites. Players can challenge this dogleg left to create a shorter second shot to the elevated green, but that brings two large fairway bunkers into play. The safer route is to the right, but creates a longer approach to the severely undulating green.\r\n\r\nThe finishing hole, a 434-yard, par 4, has a small pond and waterfall behind the green.','928-501-1500','','','','','','','','16752 W State Rte 74\r\nPeoria','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec55e77f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 85383','Semi-Private','Rees Jones','0','Bent Grass','Bent Grass','Yes','100+','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.','$150 - $200','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area, Golf School.','',1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('b552ad3e-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','ECHO VALLEY COUNTRY CLUB','This demanding course has water hazards coming into play on eleven holes.

The subtle elevation changes are enhanced by sand and grass bunkers that are placed against large multi-tiered greens. To complete the experience, the colorful backdrop is a display of rugged desert mountain vistas and the Phoenix skyline. The award-winning Raven at South Mountain has been ranked one of the top golf courses in the country and with 5 sets of tees, offers a challenge to golfers of all skill levels. The low handicap players will find the black tees, at over 7,000 yards, will require a more strategic approach and a chance to use every club in the bag. The higher handicap players will enjoy our plush, rolling fairways and larger than average greens. Before your round experience our first-class practice facility complete with putting green, chipping green with bunker, and large grass hitting area.

Bell and the site of the 1971 U.S. Public Links -- was a tougher tee time to obtain for an out-of-towner than any of Scottsdale\'s snootiest clubs. Then it all went wrong.\r\n\r\nInattention and a lack of funds took its toll, and Papago Park sank into disrepair. In early 2008, however, city officials decided to mount the kind of rescue mission that worked at Harding Park and Bethpage Black. The course was closed for extensive renovations, and then reopened in December to much praise.\r\n\r\nThe tired turf has been replaced, 30 bunkers have been added, the green sizes and contours have been restored, and the trees that obscured the views of Camelback Mountain and Piestewa Peak have been removed. With the addition of 300 yards to the tips, Papago now clocks in at an impressive 7,333 yards.\r\n\r\nWhile it may never host a U.S. Open or Presidents Cup, it hosted the 2009 J Golf Phoenix LPGA International. But all of that isn\'t really relevant, because Papago wasn\'t rescued for the pros, but for the people. The top rate here is $109 for visitors ($84 walking on weekdays and just $44 for locals).

The fairways are surrounded by desert and lined with Saguaro cactus. The greens are huge (averaging 7,000 square-feet), undulating and fast, so good lag putting is critical.\r\n\r\nThis Club has multiple courses:\r\n\r\n    Palmer Signature\r\n    Faldo Championship','480-473-0205','','','','','','','','5350 E Marriott Dr\r\nPhoenix','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec55e77f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 85054-7125 ','Resort','Arnold Palmer','1997','Bent Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','61-70','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Markedc','$125.00 - $145.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Michael Gaspard',1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('b702059b-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','RUSTIC RIDGE GOLF CLUB','Fairways are wide giving confidence on the tee.

This par 72 eighteen hole, championship track is noted for it\'s dramatic elevation changes in excess of 350 feet, and has been likened to a ride on a roller coaster ? winding through, around and among rock outcroppings, native grasses and pines. Playing to well over 7,000-feet, the course is situated at an elevation of 5,200-feet and the rolling fairways of this desert/mountain design are dramatically sculpted and lined with ponderosa and pinon pine, scrub oak, native grasses and wild flowers. Boulder and rock formations, and desert washes highlight the layout, and the large greens are well bunkered. Despite these challenges, StoneRidge\'s playability and fairness are ensured by multiple tee boxes, allowing the course to be tailored to many skill levels.

The sand bunkers on this course are also much more difficult to get out of due to more pronounced lips around the edges. The Peaks Course features fairways that are fairly restrictive. The greens are flat, medium-sized and easy to putt. Man-made lakes come into play on three holes. The signature hole is #5, a 351-yard, par 4, featuring water hazards coming into play on both sides of the fairway and requiring an approach shot to a twin-tiered green guarded by water on one side. \'Golf Digest\' rated this as the 14th \'Best in State\' course for 1995-96.\r\n\r\nThis Club has multiple courses:\r\n\r\n    Peaks\r\n    Ranch','480-471-2710','','','','','','','','18402 El Circulo Dr\r\nRio Verde,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec55e77f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 85263-5033 ','Semi-Private','David Graham','1993','Bent Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','51-60','Kirby Marking System','$125.00 - $125.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','David Cox',1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('b80a6954-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','FAIRFIELD GOLF & COUNTRY CLUB','This challenging course is also extremely scenic.

Originally designed by Arthur Hills, this is a traditional parkland style course with gently rolling terrain, and beautiful views of the mountain vistas. Measuring 6,868 yards from the back tees, The Padre Course plays to a par of 72 and boasts multiple lakes, square tees, and many bunkers to challenge golfers. The Indian Bend Course is a traditional links-style course. Designed by Jack Snyder in 1978, this 7,014 yard par 72 course features mature eucalyptus and pine trees, and colorful flowering gardens lining its fairways. The rolling tree-lined fairways are surrounded by desert and mountain views.

Several holes offer panoramic views of the McDowell Mountains and the Phoenix Valley. The most difficult hole is the 459-yard, par-4 sixth, which requires a long, straight tee shot. The 17th is a 126-yard, par 3 to an island green.

The desert frequently comes into play, but the course is not a target course. On hole #14, your tee shot must carry over a dry desert wash and a stretch of desert. The second shot is somewhat tricky since the long, slender green is set at a diagonal, requiring an approach from the right side of the fairway. The course gets its name from the large boulder which stands in the middle of the 564-yard, par-5 third hole.\r\n\r\nWeiskopf\'s Pinnacle Golf Course is a worthy companion to his previous masterpiece. Built around dramatic granite boulders and striking elevation changes, the Pinnacle course is traditional desert layout with tight landing areas and spectacular carries over desert washes. The signature hole is the 407-yard, par-4 18th which features an outstanding view of Pinnacle Peak in the background.\r\n\r\nFor more information, go to troonnorthgolf.com.\r\n\r\nThis Club has multiple courses:\r\n\r\n    Pinnacle\r\n    Monument','480-585-5300','','','','','','','','10320 E Dynamite Blvd\r\nScottsdale','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec55e77f-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 85255-4962','Semi-Private','Tom Weiskopf','1995','Bent Grass','Bermuda Grass','Yes','31-40','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$45 - $215','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area, Golf School.','Mark Richeson',1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('b94d4e36-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','TERRAVITA GOLF CLUB','This is a desert-style course that has large, undulating greens.

This is the only golf community in the country with five Nicklaus designs. These are typical desert courses in which the desert often comes into play alongside fairways and around greens. The Cochise Course is very picturesque. The greens are elevated, medium-sized, surrounded by sand bunkers, and some holes are highlighted by rock formations. Hole #7, a 215-yard, par 3, is highlighted by an elevated peninsula green. The Senior PGA Tour\'s Tradition Tournament is played on the Cochise Course in March. The Renegade Course has a unique design that includes two flagsticks on every green. This results in having six different-length courses, depending on which combination of tees and flagsticks you choose. The Apache Course, with its many grass areas and transitions to the desert, is more player-friendly than the Geronimo Course. A lake only comes into play on one hole on the Apache Course, the signature hole, which is #15, a 182-yard, par 3, requiring a tee shot to a green that slopes away from the water protecting its right side. The Chiricahua Course is a typical desert course -- open, with medium-sized, fast greens. Fairway play is forgiving off the tee, with difficulty prevalent on approach shots to the green due to well-bunkered greens surrounded by canyons. The course is very playable from all tees.

Even the most jaded travelers will be impressed.\r\n\r\nSedona\'s first 10 holes are stellar, even though homes have gradually encroached on the once-pure aesthetics. The wild ride features 300 feet of elevation change, much of it at the downhill, 183-yard, par-3 2nd hole. However, Sedona\'s signature par-3 is the incomparable 210-yard 10th, which boasts staggering views of the red rock outcroppings that dominate the horizon. A huge mound left of the green helps redirect pulled shots into birdie-putt opportunities. The greens at Sedona are topsy-turvy and jackrabbit fast, and there are plenty of ranching remnants around, such as the old rock fence and hitching post in the left rough at the closing hole. Still, the overall experience is less about the greens and more about the reds.

The Catalina Course was built in 1994 and is a typical target course. The placement of your shots is very critical because the Catalina Course has the highest degree of slope. All three courses have narrow and tree-lined fairways, along with many out-of-bounds areas. There are only a few water hazards to contend with, but you\'ll still need to make accurate shots if you wish to score well. The greens on the Saddlebrooke/Tucson Course are tiered, and the Catalina Course has very undulating greens. The head pro\'s favorite hole is #18 on the Tucson Course.

The most penal hazards are the cow pastures outside of the boundary fences. The course has undergone numerous improvements including a redesign in recent years. Five bunkers have been added to the layout which previously had none. The course was also lenghtened by relocating several tees and constructing new greens. Hole #3, a 521 yard, par 5, was recently nominated as one of the top par 5\'s in the area. This hole calls for a long drive, which will then allow a risky shot to reach the green in two.

The fairway landing areas are wide open, and the greens are well-bunkered and meticulously maintained. There is also an abundance of native grasses. With its four tee boxes per hole, golfers of all abilities will find this course an enjoyable challenge. A favorite hole is #8, a 467-yard, par 4, featuring a dogleg fairway that bends slightly to the right. Hugging the right side of the fairway is a 350-yard sand bunker. There is also a large bunker on the left to keep golfers honest. This is considered by the course\'s staff as one of the course\'s most visually impressive holes.

There are numerous trees lining most of the fairways, but some holes are open, so expect the wind to pick up now and again. Strategically placed sand bunkers, along with two ponds, have been incorporated into this course\'s design. Shot accuracy is important because the fairways are bordered by a multiple cut of rough. The signature hole is #16, a 560-yard, par 5, requiring a long tee shot if you want to reach this green in two or else you\'ll need to lay-up for an approach shot over a pond to the long and narrow green. All the greens are undulating, fast, and putt true.','319-556-3363','','','','','','','','16600 Thunder Hills Rd\r\nPeosta','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ecb59693-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 52068-9777 ','Private','Gordon Cunningham','1970','Bent Grass','Bluegrass','Yes','51-60','Sprinkler Heads Marked','$43.50 - $43.50','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro','Brian Wilson',0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('c7d56aca-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','OLD WORKS GOLF COURSE','This course, located in the heart of southwestern Montana between Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks, is the state\'s only Jack Nicklaus design. The site is rich in history and was the original location for the city\'s first copper smelter. After lying idle for nearly a century, it became a Super Fund clean-up site in 1983. In the late 1980\'s the idea of reviving Old Works with a world-class golf course became a dream of the community. Through exhaustive efforts to make the site safe, the course has become a reality and represents the first Super Fund clean-up site that has been put back into use. The course features multiple tees, which will allow players of all skill levels to enjoy the course. It is situated along Warm Springs Creek and mining remnants, such as huge piles of black slag, a by-product of the copper smelting process, lie against the hillsides. The slag is also utilized in bunkers, making for a dramatic contrast to the lush green color of the course. Native grasses have also been re-established along the fairways to blend with the area\'s natural environment. The opening hole, a 451-yard, par 4, is a good example of the strategy and shotmaking players will need to score well. Avoid Warm Springs Creek along the entire left side of the fairway. Ideal positioning is to the right-center of the fairway leaving an open shot to the green. There are also three practice holes available. There is a fifth set of tees available that measures more than 7,700 yards.\r\n\r\nThe course was ranked No. 3 on the list of 50 best courses under $50.\r\n\r\nThis Club has multiple courses:\r\n\r\n    Old Works\r\n    Little Bear','406-563-5989','','','','','','','','1205 Pizzini Way\r\nAnaconda','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed049c7e-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 59711-2778 ','Public','Jack Nicklaus','1997','Bent Grass','Fescue','Yes','41-50','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.','$36.00 - $36.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Steve Wickliffe',1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('c7e4cb64-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','ANACONDA COUNTRY CLUB','This nine hole course features tree-lined fairways.

With the August 2007 opening of The Club at Spanish Peaks, Big Sky can now boast an upscale private golf community to rival its other enticements.\r\n\r\nSpanish Peaks is located midway between Bozeman and Yellowstone National Park in southern Montana, on terrain so beautifully rugged that course designer Tom Weiskopf rode it on horseback to get a proper feel for it. He lassoed it brilliantly, carving a stunning 7,170-yard, par-72 layout.\r\n\r\nAt a literally breathtaking elevation of 7,000 feet, the course plays shorter than its yardage. But Weiskopf dished out just the right amount of eye-candy par-3s, brawny par-4s and risk/reward par-5s. The gorgeous 180-yard 15th hole, with mountains standing sentry on the horizon, and the reachable par-4 17th, a trademark Weiskopf temptation, will linger long in your memory bank.\r\n\r\nThanks to a rustic stone-and-timber motif, the development here enhances rather than competes with the environment. The 32,000-square-foot clubhouse has a mountain lodge ambience, with stunning views of the Spanish Peaks, along with a massive double-sided fireplace and a grand log staircase.\r\n\r\nCabins, condos, homes and lots are available in eight different neighborhoods, either alongside fairways or in a ski-in, ski-out parcel that\'s connected via a private ski lift to the Big Sky Resort. But in summertime spikes and clubs replace ski boots and poles. One constant is the wildlife roaming here: moose, bears and elk. To borrow a line from Seinfeld, \'They\'re real -- and they\'re spectacular!\'','877-995-3100','','','','','','','','115 Lone Peak Drive\r\nBig Sky','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed049c7e-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 59716 ','Private','Tom Weiskopf','2007','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','Not Available','','N/A','None','',0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('c81c4f8f-30b8-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','COPPER CREEK GOLF COURSE','This regulation eighteen hole course offers two entirely different front and back nines.

The course opened in June, 2003 and is laid out over a wide area, with no two holes in close proximity. This gives the golfer the impression of being totally secluded in the Iowa wilderness. The wide, rolling fairways are tree lined and highlighted by hills, bluffs, ravines, valleys and mature trees. Large, undulating greens give a \'stadium\' like impression, and can be a challenge to putt. Water comes into play on a number of holes and bunkering is adequate. The course at the Tournament Club of Iowa is touted as having the \'best collection of par 3\'s anywhere\'--involving water hazards, dramatic elevation changes and forced carries. Although this course is part of a residential development, houses are not visible during play. The course plays from 5,039 to 7,043 and offers four sets of tees to challenge a variety of handicaps.

It was never an easy walk at this hilly 1981 Jack Nicklaus design south of Denver, which climbs to 6,600 feet, but the course was always loaded with stunning par 4s, notably the watery uphill ninth, the downhill, Augusta-like 10th, and the colorful 12th, with its flower-edged cascades to the left of the green. Vickers\' constant tweaking has apparently paid off, especially on the par-5 eighth, with its redesigned green leading to more options, and on the par-5 14th, where a lake added to the left of the green has amped up the excitement quotient.\r\n\r\nIn his article My Fab 5, GOLF Magazine Top 100 Teacher Laird Small wrote that Castle Pines is one of his favorite courses in the United States. Here\'s what he wrote:\r\n\r\n\'The Rocky Mountains are just stunning, and playing at altitude puts such a unique premium on controlling your ball flight. Because the air is so thin, shots don\'t spin as much and therefore fly lower, so you are challenged to hit the ball higher if you want to stop approach shots on the green. It\'s tempting to try overpowering the course because of the scorecard distances, but the holes play shorter than their yardage, so you don\'t need to.\'','303-688-6000','','','','','','','','1000 Hummingbird Ln\r\nCastle Rock, ','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec625433-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 80104-9003 ','Private','Jack Nicklaus','1981','Bent Grass','Bent Grass','Yes','41-50','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.','$150.00 - $150.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Keith Schneider',1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('d508b497-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','DEER CREEK VILLAGE GOLF COURSE','This course features a large creek flowing through or alongside many fairways.

With great service and three 18-hole courses built by well-known designers, set in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, it is not hard to understand why.\r\n\r\nThe original Donald Ross design was split up when the East and West courses were created. Jack Nicklaus clinched the 1959 U.S. Amateur on 18th hole of Donald Ross\'s original design, but that is now the 15th on the East Course.\r\n\r\nThe majority of tournaments and events are played on the East course, which is thought to be the tougher of the two layouts that contain Ross holes. The opening holes on each course require lots of uphill shots, but the views are stunning. The landing areas are fairly open, but since you won\'t find many flat lies, hitting solid iron shots can be trickier than you think.\r\n\r\nThe Mountain Course was built in the foothills and is a bit more difficult due to its narrow fairways and the natural terrain that becomes part of the hazards you encounter. It is operated as a private club.\r\n\r\nProbably the greatest challenge of all three courses is the putting. The subtle breaks never seem to go the way you think.

In the month of September, the frost needs to melt before players are allowed on the course, so starting tee times vary between 7 AM to 10 AM. The course was built at the bases of Mt. Elbert, Colorado\'s highest mountain, and Mt. Massive, Colorado\'s second highest mountain. It was built in an extremely scenic valley that is home to an abundance of wildlife, such as prairie dogs, elk, and deer. The natural rough, a combination of sagebrush and wildflowers, is very fragile at this altitude, so carts are not permitted in the rough.

Every year, hundreds of thousands of hikers take in the dazzling environs while meandering the 1.4 mile Trading Post Loop trail. Legions also take in concerts at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, a naturally created outdoor performance space that\'s framed by two 300-foot tall rock walls and has hosted, among other performs, Sting, the Beatles, the Grateful Dead and U2. Golfers have been frequenting the area since Arrowhead opened in 1973. Designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr., the course winds through the red rocks that jut straight up from the ground like Tetons in Wyoming. Rocks, trees and water aren\'t the only things you\'ll encounter during a round at Arrowhead because deer, fox and even bears roam the area.','303-973-9614','','','','','','','','10850 W Sundown Trl\r\nLittleton,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec625433-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 80125-9077 ','Resort','Robert Trent Jones, Jr.','1974','Bent Grass','Bluegrass','Yes','51-60','Kirby Marking System','$139.00 - $145.00','Yes','Putting Green, Teaching Pro','Joseph Herbert',1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('dd057e53-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','SUNSET GOLF COURSE ','This extremely hilly course is loaded with trees.

Overall, the Pinon Course is the most difficult of the three. It was carved into the mountainside and its narrow fairways place a premium on accurate shotmaking skills. The greens are small, and water comes into play on two holes. The Ponderosa Course has tight, undulating fairways that are lined with towering Ponderosa Pines. The Meadows Course is fashioned after the Scottish links-style design. The holes meander through valley grasses, and a variety of lakes and streams will affect your shots on at least six holes. Some of the par 4\'s measure well over 400 yards and have small landing areas, so making a par will be a good score.\r\n\r\nThis Club has multiple courses:\r\n\r\n    Ponderosa/Meadows\r\n    Meadows/Pinon\r\n    Pinon/Ponderosa','970-731-4755','','','','','','','','1 Pines Club Pl\r\nPagosa Springs','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec625433-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 81147-9304 ','Resort','Johnny Bulla','1980','Bent Grass','Bent Grass','Yes','31-40','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.','$38.00 - $38.00','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Bobby Hart',1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('de6a5841-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','COLORADO GOLF CLUB ','Architects Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw j the partnership behind Sand Hills and Bandon Trails j were handed a 1,700-acre former Arabian horse ranch dusted with deep gullies, meadows and clusters of tall pines.

The fairways here hew to the lay of the land, and the artfully crafted, multi-tiered greens ensure a variety of shotmaking skills are required to navigate the challenges. After the 653-yard downhill opening hole, the course switches gears abruptly at the 154-yard, par-3 2nd, which demands a precise pitch over a wash and a pot bunker to a tiny green that rejects balls hit to the edges. Game on.\r\n\r\nBrutal two-shot holes are balanced by shorter par-4s that are reachable from the tee; split-fairway, thinking man\'s par-5s mesh with the occasional grip it and rip it test.

The Raven Golf Club at Three Peaks is a Tom Lehman/Hurzdan-Fry design that opened for play September 2000. Routed through towering pines, quaking aspens, crystal clear creeks and trout filled lakes; the Raven Golf Club at Three Peaks overloads the senses with Colorado\'s mountain beauty. This Tom Lehman, Hurdzan/Fry designed masterpiece is destined to be one of the finest golf courses in all of Colorado. The Raven is located in the majestic Gore Mountain Range and offers panoramic vistas at every turn. Stretching from 5235 to 7413 yards, the Raven Golf Club at Three Peaks offers a challenge for golfers of all abilities. The Raven Golf Club offers an appealing blend of traditional and contemporary architectural design styles. One feature of the golf course that is unique is the design of the bunkers. Patterned after legendary golf course architect Dr. Alister Mackenzie, native grasses frame the bunkers and offer a dramatic visual contrast to the emerald fairways. While they may look intimidating, the bunkers are placed as guide posts to show the golfer the way or to save errant shots. The Raven at Three Peaks is a semi private club. Public play is allowed seven days a week, with the only restriction being the first two hours of tee times Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. These times are reserved for members.','970-262-3636','','','','','','','','2929 Golden Eagle Rd\r\nSilverthorne','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec625433-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 80498 ','Semi-Private','','0','','','','','','','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','',1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('df98d477-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','SNOWMASS CLUB GOLF COURSE, THE ','This mountain course features water hazards coming into play on thirteen of the eighteen holes.

Chris Cochran of Nicklaus Design has crafted a peril-filled track with the Sangre de Christo Mountains as a backdrop. The formidable length from the tips is mitigated by the 6,000-foot elevation, but there\'s plenty of trouble here, starting with the 42 deep, black sand bunkers (a nod to the town\'s mining heritage). The flattish front nine yields to jacked up excitement on the back, notably at the stunning 163-yard 16th, which demands a short-iron dart over a yawning swath of Gray Creek to an island green that rests atop a 7,800-square-foot mesa.','719-422-7015','','','','','','','','304 Shanahan Drive\r\nTrinidad','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ec625433-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 81082 ','Semi-Private','Nicklaus Design Group - Chris Cochran','2007','Bent Grass','Bluegrass','Yes','31-40','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.','73.00 - 83.00','Yes','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area, Golf School.','Matt Reams',1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('e05d51a3-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','TRINIDAD GOLF COURSE','This was rated as the best nine hole course in the state by a local publication.

Completed in April, 2003, Baxter Spann\'s design skirts desert brush and is framed by the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and the plateau called Black Mesa. Players must shape shots suited to the land\'s contours. At the 216-yard 15th, a small hill fronting the green kicks clever approaches to front hole locations otherwise impossible to find. The 16th hole, 536 yards uphill, bears the taunting name \'Stairway to Seven.\' But the real struggle here is on the greens. By the time you find an old ranch windmill creaking in the breeze behind the 18th green, you may suspect the course is having a laugh at your expense. Some visitors complain about the blind shots at Black Mesa, but that\'s part of the experience. Just ask anyone who has played Ireland\'s Royal County Down. If this track were in Ireland, those same quirks would be considered charms.\r\n\r\nGet more information on the best courses in Albuquerque.\r\n\r\nFor more information, go to blackmesagolfclub.com.','505-747-8946','','','','','','','','115 State Rd 399\r\nEspanola,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed25625a-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 87532-3169 ','Public','Baxter Spann','2003','Bent Grass','Bent Grass','Yes','91-100','200, 150, 100 Yrd Markers and Sprinkler Heads Marked.','$62 - $87','N/A','Putting Green, Teaching Pro, Chipping Area','Tom G.

Hole #6, a 573-yard, par 5, requires an approach shot into a narrow landing area with 200-foot tall trees bordering the fairway and green. The Blackbird Course requires both accuracy and length in order to score well. Hole #8, a 212-yard, par 3, requires a tee shot onto a green that is virtually surrounded by water. Shotmaker\'s need to hit the green or land well short to be safe. This course has long, demanding holes with plenty of water and sand bunkers protecting the greens and fairways. Hole #4, a 557-yard, par 5, plays into the wind and requires a tee shot over water and onto a long, narrow fairway. Reaching the green in two on this hole will require a pair of big shots.

This \'Carnoustie of the Corn Belt\' tumbles through windswept, treeless terrain, where half the battle is keeping the ball from trundling into links-like bunkers and tall native grasses. So complete is the test offered that Wild Horse has been described as the public version of nearby Sand Hills. That comes as no surprise: course architects Dave Proctor and Dave Axland were instrumental in helping Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw create that celebrated course.\r\n\r\nThis course is a combination of Scottish/Irish links-styles. It is set on 300 acres of beautiful rolling hills on the edge of the Sand Hills. The course is lined throughout with unplayable rough that ranges between one and two-feet tall. The fairways are medium width and open, while the greens average 6,000-square feet in size, are fast and are a mixture between flat and undulating. This course has many sand bunkers and natural blowouts.\r\n\r\nFor more information, go to playwildhorse.com.','308-537-7700','','','','','','','','41150 Rd 768\r\nGothenburg','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed0bdbcc-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 69138 ','Semi-Private','Dave Axland & Dan Proctor','1998','Bent Grass','Bluegrass','No','61-70','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$35 - $54','N/A','Putting Green, Chipping Area','Don Graham',1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('f8541fd4-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','RIVERSIDE GOLF CLUB','This course features tree-lined fairways, plus a river coming into play on six holes.

The greens are average in size and are very challenging. They are quick and offer deceptive breaks. There are nine lakes and a creek that come into play on thirteen holes. One of the favorite and more challenging holes is #2, a 472-yard, par 4, which requires a tee shot to carry over a creek and fescue grass. There is a water hazard that guards most of the left side of the green, which has a very distinctive slope from right to left toward the water. There is a 40,000 square foot clubhouse that offers one of the finest dining experiences in the Lincoln area.

The course was designed on two distinct levels. Five holes were built on the lower level, one hole was built on the upper level, and four holes are bi-level. A creek meanders its way through a number of the holes. Most of the gorse-like rough has been seeded. The creek itself is overgrown with wildflowers and long grass. The mid-size greens are well manicured. Most of the bi-level holes require blind approach shots to the greens. Be careful when teeing off on holes #5 and #9. Both holes\' fairways play out onto ledges measuring 210 yards off the tee boxes, then drop about fifteen feet to the narrow fairway below.

A bunker extends all the way up the left side to the elevated green.\r\n\r\nGolf Magazine also rated Sand Hills the greatest golf course of the last 50 years.\r\n\r\nFrom Sports Illustrated Writer-Reporter Rick Lipsey: The mecca of American golf isn\'t Augusta or Pebble Beach, at least not in the eyes of aficionados like Ben Crenshaw and Jack Nicklaus. Ask them where the country\'s greatest golfing terrain sits, and they\'ll likely mention a sprawling, scrubby and desolate 19,600 square-mile tract in north central Nebraska called the Sand Hills, the biggest expanse of sand dunes in America. The terrain is perfect for golf because of the undulating topography and the beautiful flora and fauna (over 700 species of plants and 300 animal species). Opened in 1995, Sand Hills brought global acclaim for golf to the region. The private club was designed by the golf architect team of Crenshaw and Bill Corre, who turned an 8,000-acre ranch in tiny Mullen (pop. 491) into a golfing Eden. Corre and Crenshaw studied the land for two years and sketched 136 different holes before choosing the final 18, for which they moved only 3,000 cubic yards of earth during construction. Sand Hills was such a hit that star architects, including Nicklaus, are now building their own layouts in the region.','308-546-2437','','','','','','','','Hwy 97 Mile Marker 55\r\nMullen,','7f7a92b8-ea4c-11e0-8606-00306701b527','ed0bdbcc-f48c-11e0-b192-00306701b527','',' 69152 ','Private','Bill Coore & Ben Crenshaw','1995','Bent Grass','Fescue','No','71-80','200, 150, 100 Yard Markers','$150.00 - $150.00','No','Putting Green, Teaching Pro','',0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,'2012-01-03 05:50:38','a1c3e20e-f181-11e0-8a53-00306701b527',1),('fcd0ba79-30b7-11e1-9fd3-000c29a5c50c','ff2b0b4d-203c-11e1-8a87-000c29a5c50c','','0696a357-28cb-11e1-abb7-000c29a5c50c','GRANDPA\'S WOODS GOLF','This executive course was built in a scenic, remote location.
