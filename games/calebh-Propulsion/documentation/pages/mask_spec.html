<h2>MASK</h2>

<p>[array] Masks are an array of points. The points are connected in order, which forms a shape that will be used in collision detection. 
The shape formed by the points must be convex.</p>

<p>A point is an array with a length of two, with the first element representing the x coordinate of the point 
and the second element representing the y coordinate of the point. The points are relative coordinates. When a collision detection function is called, the 
points forming the mask are measured relative from the passed point.</p>

<p>The mask must be "wrapped" in a clockwise direction for the Minimum Translation Vector feature of collision detection to work properly. Each consecutive point must be clockwise from the previous point. (See the image below)</p>

<p>A common task is creating a mask to overlay a sprite. Here is an example of making a mask for a sprite.</p>

<p><img src="images/mask.png" alt="Example" class="center" /></p>
<p><img src="images/mask_enlarged.png" alt="Example Enlarged" class="center" /></p>

<p>The blue line in the enlarged image represents the origin of the sprite (see new Sprite). The red squares represent points that will be used for the mask. 
Remember that the y axis increases in the "south" direction.</p>

<div class="example">
<pre class="brush:js">
spr.pentagon = new Sprite('images/pentagon.png',1,18,33);
var mask = [[-11,0],[-17,-20],[0,-32],[17,-20],[11,0]];
</pre>
</div>
