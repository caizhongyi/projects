<h2>physics.velocity</h2>

<div class="usage">
<p>physics.velocity(obj,angle,magnitude);</p>
</div>

<div class="parameters">
obj: [object] The object to change the velocity of.
angle: [number] The direction of the object's velocity.
magnitude: [number] The magnitude of the object's velocity.
</div>

<p>This function sets the velocity of the object. The velocity can also be changed by directly changing an object's componenets of velocity, hVelocity and vVelocity.</p>
