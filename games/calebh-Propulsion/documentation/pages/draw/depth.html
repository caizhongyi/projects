<h2>draw.depth</h2>

<div class="usage">
<p>draw.depth(obj,depth);</p>
</div>

<div class="parameters">
<p>obj: [object] The object to set the depth of.</p>
<p>depth: [number] The depth to set the object to.</p>
</div>

<p>Registered objects with a higher depth property have their methods invoked last. Objects with a higher depth property will thus most likely have their draw functions invoked last, and will appear "above" other drawings.</p>
<p>Note: The new depths will only take effect after the currently running set of methods have finished running.</p>
